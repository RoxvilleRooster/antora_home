<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rocket packs burn low grade alcohol combined with
a special compound known as <em>Element X</em>. Without
this highly secret element the packs do not produce
enough thrust to lift a man off the ground, yet alone fly
around for extended periods.
A fully fuelled rocket pack has 20 units of fuel. Each player needs to track these using a counter.
Each round a pack is used for movement or to hover in place, one unit of fuel is expended.
It makes no difference how far a hero moves — the motors are more efficient at higher speeds, hence moving the regular Chase <a href="#speed">speed</a>
burns the
same fuel as moving on the tabletop, despite the former being considerably faster.
A character with an active rocket pack who lands at the very beginning of his turn, before taking any other actions, does not burn a point of fuel.
Rocket packs have no gliding capability — when the pack runs out of fuel, the hero falls from the sky.</p>

<p>During the course of an adventure, the Rocketeer may be required to travel great distances.
In order to keep fuel use practical and easy to handle, assume the packs use one point of fuel per 50 miles

<p>Rocket packs strap onto the wearer’s back and are held in place by four thick, leather straps.
These straps connect to a circular buckle which is set square in the center of the user’s chest.
Concealed within each strap are wires which feed back into the rocket pack.
Unless all four straps are connected to the buckle, the rocket pack motor cannot be ignited.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Donning a rocket pack takes an entire round and two hands.
If the Rocketeer only has one hand spare, then it takes two entire rounds.
During these rounds the character can take no other actions.
Free actions, such as moving up to one’s Pace, are permitted so long as the Ranger doesn’t use his hands.
Removing a pack can be slightly faster. Normally it takes an entire round to release the straps.
However, a character may make an Athletics roll as an action.
With success, the pack is removed and the hero can perform other actions (with a multi-action penalty).
On a failure, the character has had to spend the entire round undoing the straps.
He may take no other actions, though free actions are permitted as above.</p>

<p>To activate the rocket pack, the wearer must firmly strike a large button located on the front of his safety harness.
This is a free action, though it does require a Piloting roll.
This button can be targeted in combat by an enemy, but any attack roll suffers a –6 penalty.
Should the attack be successful, the pack switches on as if a special failure occurred (see below) or switches off if it was already activated.</p>

A result of 1 is directly behind, a 2 means he shoots at 45 degrees up and to the right, and so on. On a 9 or 10 he is rocketed straight upward.
One point of fuel is consumed.<br>
Should the hero already be airborne while trying to ignite his pack, such as when free falling from the airplane taking him to his mission, a roll of 10 indicates movement straight down, instead.</p>

<div id="speed" class="paragraph">
<p>Rocket packs have two speed settings. The first is tactical flight, while the second is long-distance flight.
Tactical mode is used for tabletop encounters, while long-distance mode is used in Chases.
Characters may <em>run</em> while using a rocket pack.
The <em>run</em> die is equal to the character’s Piloting die type, not his usual running die.
For instance, a Fleet Footed hero with Piloting d6 rolls a d6 when “running” with his rocket pack activated, not a d10 as normal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rocket packs have a single speed in each flight mode. The character has no choice as to the speed he moves—it’s all or nothing.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tactical speed is 20” per round (Acceleration is 20).</p>

<p>Long-distance flight is 140” per round.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of the distance he moves, one point of fuel is burnt.</p>

<p>The rocket pack allows the wearer to maneuver as if he were on foot. That is, he can turn through any angle he wants, swerve around objects, maneuver through narrow gaps, and so on without having to make a die roll to avoid a collision. In a Chase, the character must still make a Piloting roll each round as normal.</p>

<p>The temporary adjustment can either improve the pack’s speed by 4”/40” for the next encounter or gain the effects of a success for the next two encounters.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">Success</dt>

<p>The rocket pack’s speed is increased by 2”/20” for the next encounter.</p>

<p>The character has wasted his time. He cannot try again this mission.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Special Failure</dt>
<dd>
<p>A modified roll of 1 or lower on the Repair die (regardless of Wild Die) means the character has created an instability in the rocket pack.
All Piloting rolls are made at –1 for the remainder of the mission.
Correcting the problem requires two hours of time, suitable tools, and a Repair roll at –2.
If the Repair roll fails, the malfunction cannot be repaired in the field.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Critical Failure</dt>
<dd>
<p>The tampering has done more harm than good. Speeds are immediately halved.
Repairing the self-induced malfunction requires suitable tools, an hour, and a Repair roll at –2.
If the Repair roll fails, the malfunction cannot be repaired in the field.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rocket packs are a top secret piece of equipment highly prized by enemy nations and bad actors.
To ensure they don’t fall into enemy hands, they are equipped with a self-destruct mechanism.
The procedure for arming them is complex, but not particularly time-consuming.
It requires a Common Knowledge roll as an action to set the mechanism working. If the character has no practical familiarity with rocket packs, there is a -4 penalty on the Common Knowledge roll.
At the end of the round after the trigger is activated, the pack explodes.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The explosion fills a Medium Burst Template centered on the pack.
Everything under the template suffers 3d6 damage, plus one extra point of damage per two whole units of fuel remaining.
For example, a pack containing 9 units of fuel inflicts 3d6+4 damage when it explodes. The explosion automatically destroys the pack.</p>
