Wealth is not a trait but behaves like one in some respects. Players can spend Bennies, roll the Wild Die, and benefit from Support rolls. Typically a setting’s starting funds is $500; some settings start at $1000. The decision on the setting’s starting funds relates to the value penalty table. The Poverty hindrance decreases the Wealth die by 1 step. The Rich edge increases the Wealth die by 1 step. The Very Rich edge increases the Wealth die by 1 more step. The Fame edge adds +1 to Wealth rolls. The Famous edge adds another +1 to Wealth rolls. The cost of the item inflicts a penalty (the value penalty) on the Wealth roll. The GM has the latitude to adjust prices listed in the books for various reasons just as he can determine Availability of items. Table 1. Value Penalty Table Value Penalty Cost ($500 Starting Funds) Cost ($1000 Starting Funds) -0 Up to $250 Up to $500 -1 Up to $500 Up to $1,000 -2 Up to $1,000 Up to $2,000 -3 Up to $2,000 Up to $5,000 -4 Up to $5,000 Up to $10,000 -5 Up to $10,000 Up to $20,000 -6 Up to $20,000 Up to $50,000 -7 Up to $50,000 Up to $100,000 -8 Up to $100,000 Up to $200,000 -9 Up to $200,000 Up to $500,000 -10 Up to $500,000 Up to $1,000,000 -11 Up to $1,000,000 Up to $2,000,000 -12 Up to $2,000,000 Up to $5,000,000 Wealth roll for purchase Result Critical failure Purchase fails but hero can tray again next week or when she gets 1 or more Rewards. Failure Purchase fails and Wealth is not affected OR purchase succeeds as if a Success were rolled but there are strings attached OR purchase succeeds and the hero goes broke. Success Purchase is successful but the character’s Wealth die is temporarily reduced by 1 die step. Raise Purchase is successful; Wealth die is not reduced. You cannot purchase an item that has a penalty greater than your wealth die. For example, if the hero has a d8 Wealth, she cannot try to purchase an item with a penalty of -9 or worse (that is, greater than $200,000 in value). You cannot use Savings, benefit from Support rolls, and benefit from any other bonuses to Wealth rolls to push a hero over the purchasing limit. If the character fails the Wealth roll, the player and GM may jointly agree that it would be more interesting if the purchase succeeds. The purchase functions as if a Success were rolled but the character now owes something else to the seller that has no clear value. Examples of strings attached include: Run an errand Guard something Help me when I call Keep a secret Of course, this could introduce an economy of favors that might need tracking. There is a setting rule for favors in the Rippers Resurrected setting books. If a hero’s Wealth is reduced below d4, she’s broke. The hero as access to the basics (simple food, clean enough water, and passable shelter) unless the GM determines otherwise. The hero has no resources to purchase transportation, tasty foods, ammunition, or other typical supplies. You can only Support another character’s Wealth roll by making a Wealth roll yourself. You assume the same risks as the buyer (for example, on a Success, you lose a die type in Wealth). The rules are not clear as to whether you can Support another character’s Wealth roll using an applicable skill. For example, the GM can use his discretion and allow a character to roll the Persuasion skill to Support another character’s Wealth roll to purchase an item. If the supporting character succeeds, the supporter also loses a die type in Wealth. For items not available on the open market, you need to use the Research skill or do some Networking (SWADE 133) to find it. The GM has the say whether the item is available and the GM can assign modifiers to the rolls to find the item. Getting a Reward increases a character’s Wealth die by one step. Wealth, Rewards, and cost of living are relative. A Reward increase typically increase lasts only for a month of game. Thrifty heroes can put their Rewards into Savings. What qualifies as a Reward? To determine the reward, consider the value of the payment (and its corresponding value penalty from the table) and the hero’s Wealth die If no wealth roll would be needed to buy the Reward item/amount, it is not considered a Reward. If the value of the payment would impose half a value penalty of at least half the hero’s Wealth die. For example, in a setting where $500 is the starting funds, a $1000 reward imposes -2 value penalty. For a hero with 4d Wealth, this Reward is worth 2 Reward points. For a hero with d6 Wealth, this payment is only worth 1 Reward. If the value of the payment would impose a value penalty that is greater than the hero’s Wealth die, it is worth at least 3 Reward points. A hero can bank her Rewards by exchanging each Reward into 1 point of Savings. Maximum Savings for a hero is 4. When the hero makes a Wealth roll, she can choose to apply point from Savings. Each point of Savings use in the Wealth roll adds +1 to the result. The Savings points used are removed regardless of whether the Wealth roll succeeds. This is the standard procedure for gambling: Set the stakes (buy-in phase) Participants agree on the price (the ante). Each participant, assuming they want in on the action, makes Wealth roll (us). Apply any applicable bonuses and penalties to the Wealth roll. Observe the consequences of the Wealth rolls. Make Gambling rolls. Wild Cards who are participating make Gambling rolls. Make a \"Group roll\" for extras who are participating. Compare the results. Compare the highest Gambling result with the lowest result. If the character with the highest result (the winner) scored a success on the Gambling skill, she restores her Wealth (her ante from the buy-in phase). If the winner gets a raise, her Wealth increases by 1 step. Compare the second highest Gambling result with the second lowest result. If the character with the second highest result (the winner of that comparison) scored a success on the Gambling skill, she restores her Wealth (her ante from the buy-in phase). If the winner also gets a raise, her Wealth increases by 1 step. If there is an odd person in the game, this character restores her Wealth (her ante from the buy-in phase) as if she scored a success against. High stakes? Low stakes? When you set the stakes, consider the Wealth penalty. If the value penalty of the ante is less than or equal to one less than half of the Character’s Wealth die (that is, -1 for Wealth of d4, -2 for Wealth of d6, -3 for Wealth of d8, -4 for Wealth of d10, -5 for Wealth of d12), the character gets another step of Wealth on a success or raise. If the value penalty of the ante is equal to two less than half of the Character’s Wealth die (that is, -2 for Wealth of d4, -4 for Wealth of d6, -6 for Wealth of d8, -8 for Wealth of d10, -10 for Wealth of d12), the character increases her winnings by two \"steps\" of Wealth. In a quiet saloon, our hero, Tex McNutty, is playing cards four other cowpokes (extras). Tex just got paid so his Wealth is d6. The buy-in for this game is $250. Tex makes a Wealth roll (with the -1 value penalty applied) and gets a success; Tex’s Wealth is temporarily reduced to d4. Tex then rolls his Gambling skill (d8), which is an 11 (a raise). A group roll (SWADE 89) is made for Gambling skill of the 4 cowpokes (assume d4 Gambling and roll a wild die). The cowpokes get a 5.

All character’s begin as a member of the King’s or Queen’s Musketeers but each musketeer is different - don’t let the uniform fool you. The following are some suggested archetypes for a musketeer character. The Academic The Adventurer The Aristocrat The Artisan The Artist The Aspiring Hero The Aspiring Noble The Carouser The Duelist The Down-on-his-Luck Noble The Grizzled Veteran The Huntsman The Inspiring Leader The Man of Faith The Reformed Criminal The Peasant The Physician The Polymath The Professional Soldier The Spy The Survivor The Swordsman The musketeers accept female applicants. This is not a game about military rank. Officers and sergeants respect the opinions of all musketeers. There are no special edges for rank. All Musketeers begin with a lackey, a loyal and trusted (or maybe not) companion to their master. Lackeys may be male or female, though not every profession is open to both sexes. Lackeys are there to serve, not fight. You create a lackey as a regular character, except they are Extras, receive four attribute points, and eight skill points (plus the five default skills). No lackey may ever have Fighting or Shooting higher than d6. They are a great way of ensuring the party has access to a wide range of skills, and also for providing Cooperative bonuses where appropriate. A player should not create his own lackey. Another player character builds the lackey and plays him during the game. This allows for the Musketeer to interact with his servant in play without the player talking to himself. Whether the Musketeer has any say in the character generation is up to the individual players—some may ask for a servant with a specific skill set, while others may be happy to take pot luck. A lackey Advances like any other Extra (see Allies and Advancement in SWADE). A lackey who dies is not automatically replaced—the character must use an advance to earn a new lackey. Replaced lackeys begin with the same experience as their predecessor. Fortunately, most villains ignore lackeys who do not attack them. Unless a hero places his lackey in direct danger, villains will always target a player character over the lackey. The lackey’s basic salary (typically a small sum) is assumed covered by whatever income his master has. Any bonus rewards must come from the Musketeer’s pocket. Typically, a lackey begins with the basic tools needed for his profession, a dagger, and appropriate clothing, though the lackey’s background may alter this. A social duel is an exchange of jests, barbed comments, overt or sly insults, witty slander, and backhanded compliments. The social duel rules are intended for use in social occasions, such as balls and dances; they are not used in standard combat. A social duel takes time and requires an audience to witness the exchange. Be careful before you insult someone. Generally speaking, avoid insulting high status individuals or other luminaries unless you’re pretty sure you can win (or deal with the repercussions). See Social dueling results. Social dueling works much like the Social Conflict rules (SWADE p 143) except that Taunt is used instead of Persuasion. Another character can provide a Support roll but, if the duel is lost, that supporting character suffers the same penalties as the character who initiates the social duel. Not every NPC has Taunt. For the purpose of social dueling only, every NPC should be considered to have Taunt d4 unless he has a higher die listed—even the crudest peasant knows how to deliver a witty double entendre, throw an insult, or just deliver a defamatory statement in social situations. This replaces the Social Conflict Results table in the SWADE core rules. Losers of a social duel suffer from a loss of esteem and respect. The penalties are removed at the rate of one point per week. Word spreads around the realm. Any character with a damaged reputation will receive knowing smiles at best, and be mocked by all and sundry at worst. Alternately, the loser can demand a duel of blades or pistols. Should he win, the reputation is restored and all penalties removed. While the character is suffering a social penalty, he will not be the target of social duels—a damaged reputation cannot be further harmed until it is repaired. He may, if he so chooses, instigate social duels, though. Margin Result Tie There is no clear winner. Both parties have slandered each other, but the insults have not damaged their reputations. Neither feels the need to pursue the matter further, at least not until their next meeting. 1-2 The loser’s honor and reputation are besmirched, but only temporarily. He suffers a –1 penalty to Intimidation, Persuasion, and Taunt rolls. 3-4 A stinging remark has left a deep wound on the loser’s reputation. He suffers a –2 penalty to Intimidation, Persuasion, and Taunt roll. 5+ The target’s honor is not only tarnished, it is hemorrhaging! He suffers a –4 penalty to Intimidation, Persuasion, and Taunt rolls. How else might a character repair his reputation?

Rocketeers are typically recruited from the army, but anyone with the right aptitude can apply.

The fin acts a rudder, allowing the Rocketeer to turn at high speeds. The helmet also includes a highly secret, miniaturized radio transmitter and receiver. It has a range of just 200 yards, distance enough to let the unit talk while in flight without having to remove their helmets and shout. Flight Suit Made up of heavy boots, a flying jacket, and lightweight canvas pants, the flying suit is treated with a special fireproof liquid to prevent accidents. Rocket Pack Revolutionary in their design, rocket packs are made up of the same alloy used in the Rocketeers' helmets. Fins are fitted to the top and sides to aid in maneuvering. The fuel tank takes up most of the pack. Molecular sword See SWADE p72. Table 1. Armor Item Armor Min Str Weight Cost Notes Rocketeer Helmet 3 d4 3 Military issue Covers the head fully.

For each point of damage it takes over its Toughness from small arms fire, one point of fuel is lost. Explosive and fire damage cause the pack to overload and explode (see Rocket pack security). Every five units of fuel weighs 1 pound. Table 3. Melee weapons Type Damage Min Str Weight Cost Notes Molecular Sword Str+d8+2 d6 2 500 AP 4 Rocket packs burn low grade alcohol combined with a special compound known as Element X. Without this highly secret element the packs do not produce enough thrust to lift a man off the ground, yet alone fly around for extended periods. A fully fuelled rocket pack has 20 units of fuel. Each player needs to track these using a counter. Each round a pack is used for movement or to hover in place, one unit of fuel is expended. It makes no difference how far a hero moves — the motors are more efficient at higher speeds, hence moving the regular Chase speed burns the same fuel as moving on the tabletop, despite the former being considerably faster. A character with an active rocket pack who lands at the very beginning of his turn, before taking any other actions, does not burn a point of fuel. Rocket packs have no gliding capability — when the pack runs out of fuel, the hero falls from the sky. During the course of an adventure, the Rocketeer may be required to travel great distances. In order to keep fuel use practical and easy to handle, assume the packs use one point of fuel per 50 miles (by flying at high altitude and switching down the motors). Unless the Rocketeers can get to the correct source of fuel, there is no hope of refuelling a rocket pack during a mission. Rocket packs strap onto the wearer’s back and are held in place by four thick, leather straps. These straps connect to a circular buckle which is set square in the center of the user’s chest. Concealed within each strap are wires which feed back into the rocket pack. Unless all four straps are connected to the buckle, the rocket pack motor cannot be ignited. A Repair roll at –2 and ten minutes of work with some basic tools, overrides this safety feature. However, because the packs are given a thorough maintenance inspection after every mission, the tampering will be discovered and rectified. Failure means the character cannot try again that mission, though another hero can try on his behalf. A critical failure means the pack is broken. It cannot be repaired in the field. Donning a rocket pack takes an entire round and two hands. If the Rocketeer only has one hand spare, then it takes two entire rounds. During these rounds the character can take no other actions. Free actions, such as moving up to one’s Pace, are permitted so long as the Ranger doesn’t use his hands. Removing a pack can be slightly faster. Normally it takes an entire round to release the straps. However, a character may make an Athletics roll as an action. With success, the pack is removed and the hero can perform other actions (with a multi-action penalty). On a failure, the character has had to spend the entire round undoing the straps. He may take no other actions, though free actions are permitted as above. To activate the rocket pack, the wearer must firmly strike a large button located on the front of his safety harness. This is a free action, though it does require a Piloting roll. This button can be targeted in combat by an enemy, but any attack roll suffers a –6 penalty. Should the attack be successful, the pack switches on as if a special failure occurred (see below) or switches off if it was already activated. Raise The motor ignites using residual fumes in the exhaust. No fuel is consumed this round. The wearer may now use his rocket pack for movement. Success The rocket pack activates successfully. One point of fuel is consumed. The wearer may now use his rocket pack for movement. Failure T he motor whines, coughs, splutters, and then stops, leaving the unfortunate hero standing on the ground. A point of fuel is consumed as normal. The roll may be attempted again next round. Special Failure A natural 1 on the Piloting die (regardless of Wild Die) means the pack ignites with a sudden rush of power. Roll a d10 to determine in which direction the unfortunate Ranger is propelled. A result of 1 is directly behind, a 2 means he shoots at 45 degrees up and to the right, and so on. On a 9 or 10 he is rocketed straight upward. One point of fuel is consumed. Should the hero already be airborne while trying to ignite his pack, such as when free falling from the airplane taking him to his mission, a roll of 10 indicates movement straight down, instead. Critical Failure Flame is sucked straight into the fuel tank, starting a chain reaction. The engine fails to ignite, though one point of fuel is consumed. Worse still, the pack explodes at the end of the next round (see Security Second, above). Rocket packs have two speed settings. The first is tactical flight, while the second is long-distance flight. Tactical mode is used for tabletop encounters, while long-distance mode is used in Chases. Characters may run while using a rocket pack. The run die is equal to the character’s Piloting die type, not his usual running die. For instance, a Fleet Footed hero with Piloting d6 rolls a d6 when “running” with his rocket pack activated, not a d10 as normal. Rocket packs have a single speed in each flight mode. The character has no choice as to the speed he moves—it’s all or nothing. Tactical speed is 20” per round (Acceleration is 20). Long-distance flight is 140” per round. Because of the throttle controls that are in his gloves, a Rocketeer can control how far he moves in a round . No roll is required to hover. Regardless of the distance he moves, one point of fuel is burnt. The rocket pack allows the wearer to maneuver as if he were on foot. That is, he can turn through any angle he wants, swerve around objects, maneuver through narrow gaps, and so on without having to make a die roll to avoid a collision. In a Chase, the character must still make a Piloting roll each round as normal. A rocket pack is designed to support one person. However, in emergencies a Ranger can carry one other person (though not on this back, for obvious reasons). When carrying a comrade, all fuel usage is doubled. Typically no die roll is required to actually land and switch off the pack. However, poor visibility, high winds, trying to land in a cluttered area, and so on, may require a Piloting roll (GM’s call). Sooner or later, someone wil try to tinker with the rocket pack. A character who makes a Repair roll at –2, and spends 30 minutes, at work can tweak his rocket pack to perform better. Only one roll per pack is allowed per mission. Raise The temporary adjustment can either improve the pack’s speed by 4”/40” for the next encounter or gain the effects of a success for the next two encounters. Success The rocket pack’s speed is increased by 2”/20” for the next encounter. Failure The character has wasted his time. He cannot try again this mission. Special Failure A modified roll of 1 or lower on the Repair die (regardless of Wild Die) means the character has created an instability in the rocket pack. All Piloting rolls are made at –1 for the remainder of the mission. Correcting the problem requires two hours of time, suitable tools, and a Repair roll at –2. If the Repair roll fails, the malfunction cannot be repaired in the field. Critical Failure The tampering has done more harm than good. Speeds are immediately halved. Repairing the self-induced malfunction requires suitable tools, an hour, and a Repair roll at –2. If the Repair roll fails, the malfunction cannot be repaired in the field. Rocket packs are a top secret piece of equipment highly prized by enemy nations and bad actors. To ensure they don’t fall into enemy hands, they are equipped with a self-destruct mechanism. The procedure for arming them is complex, but not particularly time-consuming. It requires a Common Knowledge roll as an action to set the mechanism working. If the character has no practical familiarity with rocket packs, there is a -4 penalty on the Common Knowledge roll. At the end of the round after the trigger is activated, the pack explodes. Once the mechanism is triggered it cannot be switched off. The explosion fills a Medium Burst Template centered on the pack. Everything under the template suffers 3d6 damage, plus one extra point of damage per two whole units of fuel remaining. For example, a pack containing 9 units of fuel inflicts 3d6+4 damage when it explodes. The explosion automatically destroys the pack.","title":"Savage Three Rocketeers","component":"savagery","version":"master","name":"Savage_Three_Rocketeers","url":"/savagery/settings/Savage_Three_Rocketeers.html","titles":[{"text":"The Rocketeers","hash":"_the_rocketeers","id":1},{"text":"Gear","hash":"_gear","id":2},{"text":"Rocket Pack Rules","hash":"_rocket_pack_rules","id":3},{"text":"Fuel","hash":"_fuel","id":4},{"text":"Traveling long distances","hash":"_traveling_long_distances","id":5},{"text":"Refuelling","hash":"_refuelling","id":6},{"text":"Rocket pack safety","hash":"safety","id":7},{"text":"Putting on a rocket pack","hash":"_putting_on_a_rocket_pack","id":8},{"text":"Activating a rocket pack","hash":"_activating_a_rocket_pack","id":9},{"text":"Flight, speed, and maneuverability","hash":"_flight_speed_and_maneuverability","id":10},{"text":"Passengers","hash":"_passengers","id":11},{"text":"Landing","hash":"_landing","id":12},{"text":"Tinkering with a rocket pack","hash":"_tinkering_with_a_rocket_pack","id":13},{"text":"Rocket pack security","hash":"security","id":14}]},"7":{"id":7,"text":"The settings rules assume that the players play the crew like that of the Serenity.

In this instance, the hero recalls that an old friend still owes a favor. This assumes that the acquaintance has a Friendly attitude and is available to help. Only allow the player group to use the Influence the Story rule for a Favor once per session. After the acquaintance does the favor, he fades into the background unless a player spends a Benny to add the character to his list of Contacts. Now that this contact has performed the favor, the contact’s Reaction to the hero returns to Neutral. Where these rules come from These rules are from Eric Lamoureux and Just Insert Imagination's Wiseguys but they fit for the Firefly setting. Buy Wiseguys on DTRPG. Contacts are different from the Connections edge. A contact provides personal and specialized assistance. You can draw a card from a deck and then the GM can refer to chapter six in Wiseguys to generate a contact for the game. Talk to your GM about creating a contact. You can provide a hero a contact in the following ways: By spending a Benny to convert a character who performed a Favor for the hero into a Contact (see Favors). By spending a Benny to turn a character that the hero met through the Connections edge into a Contact. By meeting people during the campaign, based on the GM’s discretion and roleplay. As a reward for completing an assignment. Contacts are Wild Cards, even if they really came into the story as Extras. A player is allowed to call on one Contact per session. Contacts do not wait around and may not always be available when called on. Reciprocity is important; a contact expects the hero to return a favor when called. A loyal contact can turn if the hero mistreats him; heroes need to nurture and maintain relationships with contacts. A hero uses the Reactions table to represent the status of the relationship between a the hero and his Contact. The initial attitude of the contact depends on how the relationship starts; it is typically Neutral. If the attitude of a Contact falls to Hostile, the contact becomes a foe to the hero and the hero gains the Enemy (Minor) Hindrance. The hero can also develop the relationship with the contact and improve the attitude of the Contact’s to Helpful. In this case, the hero gets access to a “Perk” from the Contact. At the session’s start, the GM can ask each player who’s hero has a Contact to draw a card from the Action Deck. If the player draws a face card, check the Contact Event Table (Wiseguys, 33). A Perk is a service, favor, or item that a Contact offers a hero that goes beyond what a Contact generally provides a hero. Beware, a perk can come with strings attached. Firefly is all about the crew attempting to pull heists.

For each step in the heist use a different skill and have a different character perform that skill until all the key characters have their turn. You can use a Quick Encounter for a heist that is either (a) a minor part of a scenario or (b) when game time is short. Each person engaged in the heist chooses a different skill. A heist is a group effort; whether it succeeds depends on the members of the team. Consider using a preparation montage. Drop the characters into the heist and then use these mechanics and allow the players to describe the heist’s preparations. Have each player pick an appropriate skill and the group keeps the highest roll. For every success and raise, award the crew a Heist Token. Suggested skills for preparation montages: Academics Common Knowledge Electronics Hacking Intimidation Persuasion Repair Research Science Start the heist’s Dramatic Task or Quick Encounter. During the heist, the players can redeem Heist Tokens to Influence the Story as per \"Using Bennies in Savage Worlds\". A player can spend a Benny to influence the narrative, making a story, which allows the player character to use a different skill for a step of the Dramatic Task than the GM determined or call upon help from a Contact or Connections to bypass the challenge. You can use a flashback to show what happened to influence the story and facilitate the success of the heist. Examples of influencing the story include: bribing a guard placing an object that creates a diversion or distraction replacing one object (e.g., a forgery) for another bypassing a security system finding objects (e.g., uniforms, badges) or covers to blend in Heists are a fixture of a Firefly campaign.

across the globe. Of course, it is interesting if the character has some reluctance to putting herself in peril (e.g., family at home, a movie to star in, experiments to complete), but a party full of reluctant heroes who all need to be coaxed into action before an adventure creates friction in our story that we want to minimize. You can use the setting in Savaged.us at https://savaged.us/s/fxwm2vka and click User Setting to create a character. To use savaged.us, you need an account and you can create at leasts a few characters without having to pay any money. Pregenerated characters The Daring Tales of Adventure scenarios were built with the following characters in mind Brent Hardcastle https://svgd.us/jm1l6ir4 - the pilot and leading man Doc Davenport https://svgd.us/fi6gi49h - the mad scientist Amelia Valentine https://svgd.us/duchess_dtoa - the skilled leading lady Jimmy Patterson https://svgd.us/nvqwxiou - the precocious kid There is no reason why you cannot take one of these characters and adapt them to fit your play interests. Suggested motivations: Money Higher purpose (e.g., preserve, protect, redeem) Adventure and thrills Reputation, glory, and fame Professional rivalry Redemption Heroes are humans. The characters begin with 2 advances. Pulp heroes are more capable than most. At character creation, they start with 15 skill points as per the \"More skill points\" setting rule. Changed skills Hacking is reskinned as Cryptopgraphy It assumes some knowledge of codes and code breaking (e.g., Morse code) and mathematics Removed skills Focus, applies to the Arcane Background (Gifted) Faith, applies to the Arcane Background (Miracles) Language (see the Multiple Languages setting rules in SWADE p 149) Psionics, applies to the Arcane Background (Psionics) Spellcasting, applies to the Arcane Background (Magic) Changed edges New Powers (SWADE p 47) Renamed as \"New Power and New Trapping\" The weird scientist adds one new power by choosing this Edge (which may be taken multiple times) and one new power trapping. For the new power, the hero may choose from any powers of her Rank or lower that are normally available to Arcane Background (Weird Science). For the new trapping, the hero adds an effect to an existing power. For example, the player might add an electrical trapping to her hero’s existing freeze bolt; she can then switch between shock and cold trappings. Removed Edges Linguist (as per the Multiple Languages setting rules in SWADE p 149) See Arcane Backgrounds below for other unavailable edges Only the Weird Science arcane background is available for heroes. Edges that are associated with unavailable arcane backgrounds are not available to heroes. Why No Psionics? In this setting, heroes do not control the minds of others, wipe others' memories, and project mental blasts. Let’s focus on fists, bullets, and car chases and leave the superhuman and supernatural stuff to the big villains. The unavailable edges are: Extra Effort (SWADE p 46) Holy/Unholy Warrior (SWADE p 46) Mentalist (SWADE p 46) Wizard (SWADE p 47) Men of Mystery and Street-Level Superheroes If we were to build heroes such as the The Shadow and Doc Savage, we’d likely be using the Arcane Backgrounds of Gifted or Psionics. In this campaign, we are focusing on a low-powered, classic pulp adventure game a la the Indiana Jones movies or the Mummy series. Cocky (minor) The character is a braggart and will typically spend the first round of any combat announcing how great he is, or what he’s going to do to any and all opponents. Cocky is like a minor version of the Overconfident (major) hindrance (SWADE p 26). Fly (SWADE p 162) For heroes with the Arcane Background (Weird Science) edge, Fly is available at Novice rank. $500 as per SWADE.","title":"Create your pulp hero","component":"savagery","version":"master","name":"pulp_character_creation","url":"/savagery/settings/pulp_character_creation.html","titles":[{"text":"Motivations","hash":"_motivations","id":1},{"text":"Races","hash":"_races","id":2},{"text":"Initial rank and advances","hash":"_initial_rank_and_advances","id":3},{"text":"Skills","hash":"_skills","id":4},{"text":"Edges","hash":"_edges","id":5},{"text":"Arcane Backgrounds","hash":"arcane_bg","id":6},{"text":"Hindrances","hash":"_hindrances","id":7},{"text":"Powers","hash":"_powers","id":8},{"text":"Starting resources","hash":"_starting_resources","id":9}]},"10":{"id":10,"text":"This document is not intended for wide distribution.

Time and Date of Games Games will happen on Wednesday evenings at 8 pm EST. I’d like to aim for three sessions every 4-5 weeks. Attendance As long as we have 3 players, we will run a session. If we ever have fewer than 3, we’ll reschedule. Session Length A session will last about 2.5 hours (so 10:30 PM EST is the typical end). Safety Tools I’ve never used them but that does not mean we should not. This game is supposed to be run as a PG-13 movie. I want to be cognizant of ethnic and sexist stereotypes. Open Door Feel free to reach out to me to discuss points about the game, etc. Off Limits Topics Transphobia, Homophobia, Graphic violence directed towards children, Graphic depictions of torture Look up the rules later If there’s a question about rules, I’ll probably make a call (typically in favor of the players) and then look up the rule later. If I make a bad call, we’ll figure out how to make it right. I know we have some expert Savages in the crew who know the rules well and I may ask for help with a quick rule look-up. Encumbrance rules? No thanks Just be reasonable about what your hero is carrying. Golden Hour I’m indifferent to the golden hour rule and I will forget it. If you really think it should be applied, remind me and we can apply it. Money and Resources I’m pretty hand-wavy on this stuff. I hope that’s OK. Tone I’m usually shooting for 60% serious and 40% silly/fun. Character Death It is hard to kill a player in a Savage Worlds pulp action game but it might happen. If you want your character to die (e.g., a heroic death), let’s discuss that subject in advance and see how this might be meaningful to the overall story. PVP I’m inclined to avoid PVP but it can also add spice to a story. If there is PVP and mechanics need to be engaged, expect that we’ll adapt the social conflict mechanics (or possibly use the quick encounter mechanics). Dice We’re going to roll dice in Roll20. All of my dice rolls will be in the open. Shared Background and Character Bonds I am looking to adapt something (e.g., the bonds mechanic from PbtA) but I am open to ideas. 1. https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/44891/roleplaying-games/gm-dont-list-11-description-on-demand and https://gamingandbs.com/descriptions-on-demand-in-rpgs-gbs308/","title":"Playing the pulp action game","component":"savagery","version":"master","name":"pulp_intro","url":"/savagery/settings/pulp_intro.html","titles":[{"text":"Session zero","hash":"session_zero","id":1},{"text":"Introductions","hash":"_introductions","id":2},{"text":"Scheduling and the gaming group","hash":"_scheduling_and_the_gaming_group","id":3},{"text":"Communications Tools and Table Expectations","hash":"_communications_tools_and_table_expectations","id":4},{"text":"GM style","hash":"_gm_style","id":5},{"text":"Our Table","hash":"_our_table","id":6}]},"12":{"id":12,"text":"Savage Worlds Adventure Edition has a number of setting rules that are perfect for running a two-fisted pulp game.

Before the start of every combat, each hero gets a benny, provided that the benny does not exceed the character’s amount of bennies at the session’s start. A typical wild card hero has 3 bennies at session start, unless the hero as edges or hindrances that affect starting bennies. As a player (GM included!), if you have 6 or more bennies in your stack, the GM will not award you more for role-playing, etc. Spend bennies your bennies, have fun with them, and trust that that the bennies will flow back to you. The protagonists are heroes so play them that way. If a protagonist commits an evil, villainous, or morally ambiguous act, they lose a benny. This benny loss reduces the protagonist’s benny maximum until the start of the next session. For example, if the hero typically starts a session with 3 bennies, her benny limit would then be reduced to 2 for the duration of the session. The game master should warn the player about this rule and the consequences of the action before the player’s hero commits an ignoble deed. A stunt action is any action that is performed in a flashier than normal way. Any hero who attempts a stunt action deserves a benny. In game terms, a stunt is an action where the player purposefully makes the action more difficult for the hero. A stunt action always requires a trait roll, at a minimum -2 penalty. The GM is the final arbiter of the roll penalty of a particular stunt action. Conventional action Getting on board an airship before it lifts off from the platform is an action Stunt action Leaping from the sidecar of a speeding motorcycle onto an airship at the last second as it lifts off from the platform. When the heroes surrender at a dramatically fitting place in the story and go along with the demands of the antagonists, each player takes a benny. The GM may need to signal that we’re using the \"surrender\" rule at this point. Most action scenes in pulp need to be fast-paced and not get bogged down in combat mechanics. Do not expect standard tactical combats that last beyond 3 or 4 rounds. For a standard combat, I’ll apply the \"timers, threats, and treats\" guidance from ICRPG. The SWADE quick encounter mechanics will be used regularly. The dramatic task mechanics will feature prominently. The chase rules will be used regularly so players are encouraged to have some familiarity with them as they would the combat mechanics. In a pulp game, death is not gory and messy. Once per adventure, one of the players can invent a Contact, who is a slightly helpful non-player character. A player may invent a Contact for his hero once per rank. A contact typically serves to provide gear, information, or clues and leads when parties are struggling. The GM gets the final decision on what the Contact provides the heroes. Heroes do not suffer a permanent injury. When the wounds from the injury heals, the hero no longer suffers the effect of the injury. A character may spend a Benny at any time to make a Natural Healing roll. At the end of the scene, heroes recover all spent ammunition. The cops do not turn up on the scene until after the action has ended.","title":"Classic two-fisted pulp adventures","component":"savagery","version":"master","name":"pulp_setting_rules","url":"/savagery/settings/pulp_setting_rules.html","titles":[{"text":"Setting Rules","hash":"_setting_rules","id":1},{"text":"Bennies","hash":"_bennies","id":2},{"text":"Be the Hero","hash":"_be_the_hero","id":3},{"text":"Stunts","hash":"_stunts","id":4},{"text":"Surrender","hash":"_surrender","id":5},{"text":"Setting the tone","hash":"_setting_the_tone","id":6},{"text":"Cinematic death","hash":"_cinematic_death","id":7},{"text":"Contacts","hash":"_contacts","id":8},{"text":"Injuries are temporary","hash":"injuries_are_temporary","id":9},{"text":"Never-ending ammo","hash":"_never_ending_ammo","id":10},{"text":"Police Interference","hash":"_police_interference","id":11}]},"13":{"id":13,"text":"Table 1.

Weapon Mount Most machine-guns require a bipod, tripod, or vehicle mount to fire, which eliminates any Strength requirement and the Recoil penalty (see SWADE p 105). Their Minimum Strength is listed as “NA,” or “Not Applicable.” If a weapon has a Minimum Strength listed, it may be fired from the hip with the Snapfire and Recoil penalties.

You are agents working together in a joint mission under the service of The Agency, (NATO nations). All the mission details are available as handouts inside the Roll20 campaign. See the Roll20 campaign. Savage Worlds Adventure Edition has a number of setting rules that are good for running Top Secret espionage game. Gritty Damage (SWADE p 139) Multiple Languages (SWADE p 149) A stunt action is any action that is performed in a flashier than normal way. Any hero who attempts a stunt action deserves a benny. In game terms, a stunt is an action where the player purposefully makes the action more difficult for the hero. A stunt action always requires a trait roll, at a minimum -2 penalty. The GM is the final arbiter of the roll penalty of a particular stunt action. Conventional action Getting on board a helicopter before it takes off from the platform is an action Stunt action Leaping from a moving vehicle to grab on to the helicopter as the helo is taking off. When the heroes surrender at a dramatically fitting place in the story and go along with the demands of the antagonists, each player takes a benny. The GM may need to signal that we’re using the \"surrender\" rule at this point. Characters begin at novice rank with no advances. In addition to the standard core skills, characters have 12 skill points to spend at novice. Agency training gives a novice agent the following skills at a d4: Fighting Shooting Tradecraft Demolitions Electronics Some sample tokens are in Google Drive here. And there’s a playlist. Agents begin with the major hindrance Obligation. This does not count towards your normal Hindrance total. Besides their native tongue, all agents know half their Smarts die in languages. They speak with an obvious accent, betraying their nationality. Social interaction skills dependent upon speech are at a -2 when attempted in the speaker’s nonnative tongue. Demolitions (Smarts) The ability to identify, set, shape, and defuse explosives. Explosions may be planted in a focused and discrete manner, or \"shaped\" to cover a greater area. Forgery (Smarts) The ability to fabricate, adapt, or imitate objects or documents with the intent to deceive. Attempting to make forgeries without the proper tools is done at -2. The tools vary wildly, depending upon the nature of the item in question. Tradecraft (Smarts) This skill focuses on the application of procedures and protocols, such as dead drops, brief encounters, pickups, load and unload signals, danger and safe signals, and surveillance and counter-surveillance. The tradecraft skill also covers knowledge of other agencies as well as aiding in field requisitions and governs exactly what you can requisition.

Damage is applied to the least armored location (victims in completely sealed suits are immune). Split: Some swarms split into two smaller swarms when Wounded (GM’s call). Reduce the Blast Template one size after a Wound; Small swarms are destroyed. Swarm: Parry +2. Because the swarm is composed of scores, hundreds, or thousands of creatures, cutting and piercing weapons do no real damage. Area effect weapons work normally, and a character can stomp to inflict his damage in Strength each round. Some swarms (bees, hornets, birds) may be foiled by total immersion in water. This category covers all the various types of auxilia, including archers, slingers, skirmishers, medium infantry (cohortes), cavalry.

Their long nails may be able to tear through flesh, but their most feared power is their terrible keening, which can drive a man mad. Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d6, Spirit d8, Strength d6, Vigor d8 Skills: Fighting d6, Notice d8, Stealth d6 Pace: 6; Parry: 5; Toughness: 8 Special Abilities Claws: Str+d4. Scream: Once per night, and again anytime a banshee draws a Joker in combat, it may elicit the banshee’s trademark scream. Anyone within 12\" (24 yards) must make a Spirit roll or die. Those who are successful automatically lose one point of Sanity and are Shaken. Undead: +2 Toughness; +2 to recover from being Shaken; no additional damage from called shots; immune to disease and poison; does not suffer wound penalties. As far back as the Stone Age, the Celts and Germanic tribes of Britannia and Northern Europe threw human sacrifices in dark bogs. Over the centuries, the peat rich waters of the bogs mummified the bodies, turning their skin hard and black, glistening with an unholy pallor. Lengths of rope, used to strangle them in life, and broken spear points, used to impale them, protrude from their blackened corpses. Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d6, Spirit d10, Strength d8, Vigor d8 Skills: Fighting d8, Notice d8, Stealth d12 Pace: 4; Parry: 6; Toughness: 8 Special Abilities Burrow: Bog men move through water and boggy soil at Pace 6. When they erupt from the ground, victims must make a Notice roll opposed by the bog man’s Stealth. If the creature wins, it gains +2 to attack and damage that round, or +4 with a raise. Slam: Str. Strangle/Drown: Bog men usually attack by grappling their foes, inflicting Str damage each round. If their slam attack is a raise, however, they have grasped their foe around the neck or dragged them underwater. Victims must make a Vigor roll each round on the bog person’s Action Card (a free action) or suffer a level of Fatigue. This can lead to Death. Thermal Vision: Bog people have no eyes, just sunken pits, yet they can locate victims with ease. They suffer no penalties during the day, and halve all Darkness penalties. Undead: +2 Toughness; +2 to recover from being Shaken; no additional damage from called shots; immune to disease and poison; does not suffer wound penalties. Weakness (Fire): Bog bodies are infused with peat-saturated water and take +4 damage from fire. “Friendly fire” is present in every conflict, but more so during Rome’s frequent civil wars, when legionaries on both sides wear exactly the same armor. While much of it can be chalked up to the confusion inherent in battle, the fiendish creature known as the fog of war certainly does its best to facilitate such tragedies. In its natural form, a fog of war is a cloud of gray mist filling a Small Burst Template. Occasionally, the faces of pained and dying soldiers from various wars may appear fleetingly in the smoky form, psychic impressions left from previous victims. The fog of war is able to alter its form into nearly any shape of equal volume when the need arises. These sentient killers sow paranoia, fear, and confusion in an effort to promote friendly fire. They do this through subtle means, such as depriving troops of sleep and putting them on edge, altering perceptions with magical abilities, or simply dominating an officer to order an action leading to fratricide. Fogs of war find glee in such senseless and unfortunate deaths. Attributes: Agility d4, Smarts d6, Spirit d8, Strength d4, Vigor d8 Skills: Notice d6, Persuasion d8, Stealth d10 Pace: 6; Parry: 2; Toughness: 6 Special Abilities Domination: A fog of war attacks victims simply by engulfing it within its foggy tendrils. Any creature caught inside must make a Vigor roll each round to avoid inhaling. Those who do are subject to domination by the fog of war. This works like the puppet spell, with the fog’s Spirit replacing the arcane skill roll. The Duration of this power is variable. So long as the victim remains within the fog, he is subject to the power. Once he leaves, it lasts for 10 rounds. Gaseous Form: As a result of its insubstantial nature, the creature suffers half damage from all forms of damage. It can pass through small holes or narrow openings. It can’t enter water or other liquid. Illusions: A fog of war can create minor illusions of sight and sound with a successful Spirit roll opposed by the target’s Smarts. Illusions have no physical form, and are used simply to confuse, startle, or disorient victims. Powers: A fog of war can use the obscure, speak language, and telekinesis powers using its Spirit as its arcane skill. It has unlimited Power Points. Weaknesses: Strong winds or rain quickly disperse the fog (1d4 rounds). A fury forms from the tumult of frenzied activity found on battlefields where hand to hand combat takes place. The frenetic action, fear, rage, and death cause a whirling cloud of battlefield debris to form. This swirling mass of swords, spears, bits of armor, and even blood-soaked body parts rises up from the heaviest fighting and moves along the battle lines, attacking each side indiscriminately. In truly huge battles, several furies can form in different spots across the battlefield. Once the passions of combat subside, the fury will settle to the ground, becoming indistinguishable from the detritus of war. Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d6, Spirit d10, Strength d6, Vigor d12 Skills: Fighting d6 Pace: 6; Parry: 7; Toughness: 10 Special Abilities Fear: A tornado of weapons, armor, and body parts is terrifying to behold. Fearless: Immune to Fear and Intimidation. Storm of Steel: A fury fills a Small Burst Template with whirling bits of flying debris. Each turn it moves a full Pace across a battlefield increases its size by a larger Burst Template. Any character in the template is attacked by the fury for 2d6 damage. Furies will not attack anyone who goes prone, however. Swarm: Parry +2. The fury consists of scores of broken weapons, armor, and body parts. Cutting and piercing weapons do half damage. Area-effect weapons work normally. Weakness (Magic): Magical weapons (including those blessed by smite spells and the like) do full normal damage. Weakness (Test of Fury): Mighty warriors or pious holy men can attempt to absorb the fury’s energy into themselves. With a raise on an opposed Spirit roll, the fury’s energy is dispersed. Specters, shades, and phantoms sometimes return from death to haunt the living or fulfill some unfinished business. Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d6, Spirit d10, Strength d6, Vigor d6 Skills: Athletics d6, Common Knowledge d8, Fighting d6, Intimidation d12, Notice d12, Stealth d12, Taunt d10 Pace: 6; Parry: 5; Toughness: 5 Edges: - Gear: Thrown objects (Str+d4). Special Abilities Ethereal: Ghosts are invisible and immaterial at will and can only be harmed by magical attacks. Fear (-2): Ghosts cause Fear checks at -2 when they let themselves be seen. A 'glom (short for conglomerate) is a group of corpses joined together into a horrifying mass and animated by the weird energies generated on the battlefield. The parts of the component bodies can be seen clearly, although they are merged inseparably into a single horrific mass. The creation of a 'glom requires at least two corpses. One corpse, which forms the core of the creature, must be relatively intact, but the others needn’t be so tidy. Most 'gloms are formed from considerably more than two corpses. The 'glom is able to join additional corpses to its seething mass, increasing its power proportionately. 'Gloms use their limbs and whatever weapons are handy to kill any living person in sight. Whenever possible, 'gloms add corpses to their mass. 'Gloms can ranged weapons if available, though since its limbs often flail wildly, any shots fired by the 'glom suffer a -2 penalty. Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d4, Spirit d4, Strength d8, Vigor d8 Skills: Fighting d8, Intimidation d6, Notice d10, Shooting d4 Pace: 6; Parry: 6; Toughness: 9 Gear: 'Gloms may carry weapons according to the number of hands they possess. Special Abilities Claws: Str+d4. Strength depends on the number of corpses in the creature (see below). Fear (-2): Anyone viewing a 'glom must make a Fear test (-2). Fearless: 'Gloms are immune to Fear and Intimidation. 'Glom: A 'glom takes a full round to add a corpse to its mass. For every corpse after the second, the 'glom gains one die each in Strength and Vigor. It also gains +1 Size. A 'glom suffers no multi-action penalties until it takes more actions in a turn than it has corpses in its mass. A 'glom may grow as large as 10 corpses (Strength and Vigor d12+6, Size +9). Size +1: 'Gloms start out with two corpses incorporated into their mass. Undead: +2 Toughness, +2 recover from being Shaken, no additional damage from Called Shots, ignores wound penalties, immune to disease and poison. Weakness (Head): Shots to the 'glom’s primary head do +2 damage. Piercing attacks do normal damage. A Notice roll at a -1 cumulative penalty for each 'glommed reveals which of a 'gloms many heads is the primary. A hate is formed when multiple souls suffer a collective fate. They are most commonly found on battlefields, at scenes of massacres, and in death camps. When the bodies of the victims die, their souls flock to form a mass of swirling, screaming spirits. Hates are filled only with thoughts of vengeance. Although initially they target those who oppressed them in life, their desire for revenge can never be truly sated, and any living creature becomes suitable prey. Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d6, Spirit d10, Strength d6, Vigor d10 Skills: Notice d6 Pace: 6; Parry: 4; Toughness: 7 Special Abilities Fear: Within a hate can be seen the leering faces of the vengeful dead. Fearless: Immune to Fear and Intimidation. Immunity: Hates cannot be harmed by physical weapons. Rage: A hate fills a Large Burst Template. Any character in the template must make an opposed Spirit roll. Failure means the victim goes berserk (as the Edge) and launches a violent attack against the nearest character, friend or foe. Victims may attempt to break free (another opposed Spirit roll) on their action each round. Swarm: Parry +2. The hate is composed of scores of souls, cutting and piercing weapons do no real damage. Area-effect weapons work normally. Weakness: Magical weapons (including those blessed by smite spells and the like) do full normal damage. They are also vulnerable to weapons taken from the dead of a battlefield in which the hates were created. A husk is created when a person dies of extreme heat or cold. A husk’s skin dries and shrivels, becoming tough and leathery. Its eyes sink into its sockets and blood is the only thing that can sustain it. Husks are instinctive predators and very cunning. They may stake out a desert oasis or warm spring, the water useless to them, but a draw for their human prey. They may also stalk a convoy or caravan, hoping to pick off any stragglers. Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d6, Spirit d8, Strength d6, Vigor d8 Skills: Climbing d6, Fighting d8, Notice d6, Stealth d8 Pace: 6; Parry: 6; Toughness: 8 Special Abilities Bite/Claw: Str+d4. Environmental Protection: Husks ignore all damage from heat or cold-based attacks. Frenzy: Husk may make two attacks at -2. Level Headed: Husks get two Action Cards and act on the best. Undead: +2 Toughness; +2 to recover from being Shaken; no additional damage from called shots; immune to disease and poison; does not suffer wound penalties. A few warriors go mad and absorb the negative energy, transforming into inhuman killing machines that indiscriminately attack both friends and enemies. These “hydes” are a danger to anyone they encounter. Attributes: Agility d10, Smarts d4, Spirit d6, Strength d12+2, Vigor d10 Skills: Climbing d6, Fighting d6 Pace: 8; Parry: 5; Toughness: 8 Edges: Improved Nerves of Steel Hindrances: Bloodthirsty Special Abilities Shape Change: Anytime a soldier’s Sanity is 0 and he draws a Joker for Initiative, he must make a Spirit roll. If he rolls a 1 he transforms into a hyde. Hyde Form Area Appearing: Any battlefield. Claws: Str+d4. Improvised Weapons: While a hyde is too crazed to use firearms, they use rifles and machine guns as clubs. Shape Change: If a hyde is dealt a Two, he automatically changes back to his human form. Size +1: Hydes stand seven feet tall, and weigh over 300 pounds. The sluagh is a horde of evil spirits that manifests itself as a flock of large, black, crow-like birds. Their only goal is to capture and devour the souls of the dying, which means a battlefield is something of an all-you-can-eat buffet for them. Although they usually appear on battlefields, they may sometimes attack lone humans and peck them to death. Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d8, Strength d10, Vigor d10 Skills: Notice d8 Pace: -; Parry: 4; Toughness: 7 Special Abilities Bite/Claw: Sluagh attack everyone within the flock every round, hitting automatically for 2d4 damage. Characters inside solid buildings are immune. Light cover, like a tent or canvas tarp, is shredded and rendered useless in three rounds. Destabilization: If the sluagh pass over an Incapacitated victim, he must make a Vigor roll at -2 or perish. Fly: Pace 12, Climb 3. Low Light Vision: Sluagh ignore the penalties for Dim and Dark lighting. Swarm: +2 Parry. Sluagh attack in flocks of up to 100 birds. These flocks are treated as an individual creature the size of a Medium Burst Template. The flock can only be harmed by area effect attacks. A Wound disperses the flock. Certain British warriors, blessed by their dark gods through bloody rituals, have the power to transform into man/bear hybrids. They do not pass on their bloodline through their attacks, nor are they immune to mundane weapons. Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d6, Spirit d8, Strength d12+6, Vigor d12+2 Skills: Athletics d10, Fighting d12, Intimidation d10, Notice d12, Stealth d8, Survival d8 Pace: 6; Parry: 8; Toughness: 11 Edges: Alertness, Combat Reflexes, Sweep Special Abilities Bear Hug: A werebear who hits with a Fighting attack and also succeeds a raise has pinned (i.e., Entangled and Bound) his foe and may bite at +2 until the foe is freed. The opponent may only attempt to escape the hug on his action. To completely break free of the bear hug, the victim of the hug must improve his status so that he is no longer Bound nor Entangled. The werebear resists attempts to break free using Strength. The werebear is not subject to the customary -2 penalty when using Strength in grappling. Bite/Claws: Str+d8. Low Light Vision: Werebears ignore penalties for Dim and Dark lighting. Shapechanger: Werebears can change between their human and man/bear hybrid forms as a normal action by making a Vigor roll at +2. With a normal success, they can’t take any other actions that round, including movement. With a raise, they can take other actions as normal. Size +2: These creatures stand up to 8' tall and weigh over 1000 pounds each. Wereboars are found only among the Picts, and serve as their elite warriors. Legio XX’s symbol was a boar, and they were stationed on the border between Britannia and Caledonia for much of their existence. Coincidence? Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d4, Spirit d10, Strength d12, Vigor d10 Skills: Fighting d10, Intimidation d10, Notice d8, Stealth d8 Pace: 6; Parry: 7; Toughness: 8 Edges: Berserk, Improved Nerves of Steel Special Abilities Hardy: Multiple Shaken results do not cause a wound. Low Light Vision: Werebears ignore penalties for Dim and Dark lighting. Shapechanger: Wereboars can change between their human and man/boar hybrid forms as a normal action by making a Vigor roll at +2. With a normal success, they can’t take any other actions that round, including movement. With a raise, they can take other actions as normal (wereboars can also take on a true boar form, see p. 131). Size +1: These creatures stand up to 7' tall and weigh over 700 pounds each. Tusks: Str+d8. Will o' wisps are the ghosts of men who died in lingering agony after being wounded, their piteous cries for help going unheeded. With their last breathe they cursed their god and their comrades, unintentionally binding their spirit to the killing ground. They manifest as small handfuls of flickering white flame that is oddly cold to the touch rather than hot. Some soldiers claim to have seen a grinning face inside a will o' wisp. A will o' wisp uses the glimmering light produced by its form to lure its intended victim to a secluded spot. Appearing to be a wounded man, the wisp favors its comrades whom it blames for its death. Once they approach, it weakens its victims with a fire seeming to spring from Hell itself. Once the target succumbs to the heat, the ghost possesses his corpse which immediately bursts aflame. These burning zombies are sometimes referred to as “flaming jacks.” The ghost uses the reanimated body to wreak as much havoc as it can before it is consumed by the creature’s otherworldly flames- usually against the other members of the litter team now. Initially, a will o' wisp haunts the area near its death, seeking vengeance on its former comrades. Once it has revenged itself, the hatred and anger that drove it to an undead existence continue to burn within the ghost. Some areas of No Man’s Land flicker with small lights once night falls over the blasted landscape. In these areas, litter teams often request chaplains to accompany them to perform “last rites” when they head out at night to recover the wounded following an offensive. The light of a will o' wisp varies from cold white to flame orange. The ghost can lessen its brilliance to that of a mere candle or brighten it to that of a torch at will. Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d8, Spirit d10, Strength d4, Vigor d6 Skills: Fighting d6, Notice d10, Stealth d8, Taunt d6, Survival d8 Pace: -; Parry: 5; Toughness: 4 Special Abilities Ethereal: Will o' wisps are immaterial. They don’t suffer additional damage from called shots, and are immune to disease and poison. Fearless: Will o' wisps are immune to Fear and Intimidation. Flaming Jack: The will o' wisp can reanimate and possess the body of a victim slain by its Spiritual Exhaustion (see below) attack. Flight: The will o' wisp flies at Pace 8. They may not “run.\" Focus: The ghost is tied to a specific talisman-usually an identity disk—which remains unnaturally hot to the touch (2d6 damage to exposed flesh). If this item is submerged in water, the will o' wisp suffers 2d6 damage per round as long as it remains so. If it is submerged in holy water, the wisp is destroyed immediately. Invulnerability: Will o' wisps are immune to nonmagical attacks but suffer 1d6 damage when doused in at least a gallon of water, +2 per additional gallon. Spiritual Exhaustion: A will o' wisp’s only means of attack in its initial form is by subjecting its victim to a supernatural heat only she can feel. The wisp and its target make an opposed Spirit roll. If the victim loses, the victim suffers a Fatigue level. Size -1: Will o' wisps are approximately two to three feet in diameter. Weakness (Holy Water): Sprinkling a will o' wisp with holy water does 2d10 damage to it. When a full moon emerges, humans infected with lycanthropy lose control and become snarling creatures bent on murder. Some embrace their cursed state and revel in the destruction they cause. Customize the Special Abilities that make sense for your particular flesh-ripper. Older or “pure-blood” lycanthropes may be Invulnerable to all but silver or magic, for example. Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d6, Spirit d6, Strength d12+2, Vigor d10 Skills: Athletics d8, Common Knowledge d8, Fighting d12+2, Intimidation d10, Notice d12, Stealth d10, Survival d10 Pace: 8; Parry: 9; Toughness: 8 Edges: - Special Abilities Bite/Claws: Str+d8. Fast Regeneration: Werewolves may attempt a natural healing roll every round unless the Wounds were caused by silvered objects. Fear (-2): Werewolves chill the blood of all who see them. Infection: Anyone slain by a werewolf has a 50% chance of rising as a werewolf themselves. The character involuntarily transforms every full moon. He gains control of his lycanthropy only after 1d6 years as a werewolf. Infravision: Halve penalties for Illumination when attacking warm targets. Size 1: Werewolves are stout creatures. Those wounded by werewolves but not slain become wolfmen. They are bloodthirsty savages when the full moon transforms them. Attributes: Agility d10, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d8, Strength d10, Vigor d8 Skills: Fighting d8, Notice d8, Stealth d4, Survival d6 Pace: 6; Parry: 6; Toughness: 6 Special Abilities Bite: Str+d6 Go for the Throat: If a wolfman hits on a raise, it strikes its opponent in his least armored location. Fleet-Footed: A wolfman rolls a d10 running die instead of the usual d6. Immunity: Wolfmen take half damage from all attacks, except those made by silver or magic. Improved Frenzy: Wolfmen can make 2 Fighting attacks each round at no penalty. Weakness (Magic/Silver): Wolfmen take full damage from magic and silver weapons. These walking dead are typical groaning fiends looking for fresh meat. Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d4, Spirit d4, Strength d6, Vigor d6 Skills: Athletics d4, Fighting d6, Intimidation d6, Notice d4, Shooting d6 Pace: 4; Parry: 5; Toughness: 7 Edges: - Special Abilities Bite/Claws: Str. Fearless: Zombies are immune to Fear and Intimidation. Undead: +2 Toughness; +2 to recover from being Shaken; no additional damage from Called Shots; ignores 1 point of Wound penalties; doesn’t breathe; immune to disease and poison. Weakness (Head): Called Shots to a zombie’s head do the usual +4 damage. Arboris bellum (war trees) are trees animated through dryad or special druidic magic. They are not sentient, but possess animal-like intelligence. Trees older than a century are Wild Cards. Attributes: Agility d4, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d10, Strength d12+6, Vigor d10 Skills: Fighting d8, Notice d6 Pace: 6; Parry: 6; Toughness: 19 (4) Special Abilities Armor +4: Thick bark. Branch Swipe: Str+d6, Reach 2. Huge: Attackers are +4 to attack rolls against an arbor bellum due to its size. Plant: +2 to recover from being Shaken; No additional damage from Called Shots; Immune to poison and disease. Size +8: An arbor bellum is over 40' tall. Stomp: Str+8. The creature is naturally adept at using its full weight to smash its foes. Nonrigid armor (leather, any lorica armor) offers no protection against the stomp attack. Improved Sweep: An arbor bellum can attack all adjacent opponents in reach at no penalty. Weakness (Fire): Fire attacks cause +4 damage-unless it’s raining. This entity resembles a noxious mist that flows in large pseudopods and writhing tentacles, filling a Large Burst Template. The cloud tries to influence any creature it touches, with the power of pure, white-hot rage. Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d4, Spirit d8, Strength d8, Vigor d8 Skills: Fighting d8, Notice d8 Pace: 6; Parry: 6; Toughness: 6 Special Abilities Death Feeding: The Cloud of Hate grows stronger in the presence of death and destruction. For every four people slain in its presence, it gains +1 to Toughness and one die type of Strength for 1d6 hours (maximum of +2 and d12). Enthrall: The Cloud of Hate seeks out those filled with hatred and violence. It can use the puppet power, with a Range of Spirit * 2\", using its Spirit as the arcane skill. The Cloud of Hate can cast and maintain the power indefinitely but may only affect a number of targets equal to its Spirit die value. Fearless: Immune to Fear and Intimidation. Invulnerability: The Cloud of Hate cannot be harmed by physical or magical attacks, except for its Weaknesses. Tendrils: When fully fed (+2 Toughness and d12 Strength), the Cloud of Hate can manifest up to ten tentacles (Str, Reach 1) capable of manipulating objects and wielding weapons. The cloud may use all its tentacles each round without a multi-action penalty. Weakness (Cord): The cloud is tethered to those who summoned it with a stream of pinkish-silver energy. This is the source from which the Cloud draws its power. Discovering the tether requires a successful Notice roll at -4. Attacking the cord requires a called shot at -2 and deals normal damage to the cloud. Weakness (Eye): The Cloud of Hate has a large central eye. Attacking the eye requires a called shot at -4. If the cloud suffers a wound from the attack, it is blinded instead, suffering a -6 to all rolls dependent on vision, including attacks. Corpse ravens, found among the Gallic and Germanic lands, feast only on those fallen in battle. Some say they are servants of the barbarian gods of death, others insist they are pets of the gods of war, allowed to feed only on the flesh of heroes. Whoever they serve, they can raise the dead. Attributes: Agility d10, Smarts d6 (A), Spirit d8, Strength d8, Vigor d10 Skills: Notice d6 Pace: 10; Parry: 4; Toughness: 7 Special Abilities Claw: Swarms inflict hundreds of tiny bites every round to their victims, hitting automatically and causing 2d4 damage to everyone in a Medium Burst Template. Damage is applied to the least armored location. Flight: Pace 8, Climb 3. Swarm: Parry +2; Because the swarm is composed of scores, hundreds, or thousands of creatures, cutting and piercing weapons do no real damage. Area-effect weapons work normally, and a character can stomp to inflict his damage in Strength each round. Swarms are usually foiled by jumping in water (unless they are aquatic pests, such as piranha). Zombie: Corpse ravens can settle on corpses and give them unlife. Roll a die per corpse. Odd, it rises as a zombie (see Savage Worlds). The undead is uncontrolled and attacks the nearest living target. Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d4, Spirit d6, Strength d10, Vigor d10 Skills: Fighting d8, Intimidation d10, Notice d8, Stealth d10, Survival d10 Pace: 8; Parry: 6; Toughness: 8 (1) Edges: Improved Frenzy Gear: Two bone sabers (Str+d8) or bone axe (Str+d8) and Spiked Shield (+1 Parry, -2 Cover, Str+d4+2 damage in Shield Bash) Special Abilities Armor +1: Shaggy fur. Fear (-2): The sight of a beast man terrifies anyone who encounters one. Low Light Vision: Beast men ignore penalties for Dim and Dark lighting. Goat Feature - Gore: Beasts which move at least 6\" can make a Horns attack with +4 damage. Horns: Str+d4. Infravision: Beasts halve penalties for dark lighting conditions against living targets (round down). Lord of the Pack: Every pack is led by the most powerful individual, a Wild Card with Strength, Vigor and Fighting raised by one die type. He can cast the boost trait, protection and sloth/ speed Powers with 10 Power Points, using Spirit as arcane skill. Disease: Anyone damaged by a beast’s physical attack who fails a Vigor roll catches a nasty disease. Each day thereafter, the victim must make a Vigor roll or lose one die of Strength and Vigor. If either attribute drops below d4, the victim dies. A Healing roll may be attempted each day to cure the disease. Reduced attributes return at the rate of one die per day. A manticora has the body of a lion and a vaguely human head. Its mouth contains three rows of razor sharp teeth and its tail ends in a ball of darts or spines. Manticorae are fierce predators and devour every part of their victims, including their gear. They are most often encountered in the Asiatic provinces. Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d6, Spirit d8, Strength d12+2, Vigor d10 Skills: Climbing d8, Fighting d8, Intimidation d8, Notice d8, Shooting d8, Stealth d8, Tracking d6 Pace: 8; Parry: 6; Toughness: 9 Special Abilities Bite/Claw: Str+d6. Defensive Volley: Rather than fire its tail darts at one target, the manticora may launch them in a circular pattern. The manticora makes a single Shooting roll against all target within range for 2d6 damage. The manticora may take no other actions in the round it uses this ability, including movement. This ability may be used only once per day and uses all the darts in the tail. There must be at least three volleys of darts left for this ability to work. Improved Frenzy: Manticorae may make two Fighting attacks each action at no penalty. Tail Darts: Each round, a manticora may fire a volley of darts at one target. Range 4/8/16, Damage 2d6. It may not fire its darts at the same target it attacks with its claws or bite during the same round. A manticora can only fire 10 volleys in a single day. Size +2: Manticorae weigh over 600 pounds. These fell creatures were once normal men and women who made a dire pact with an evil entity. It is said that nightgaunts are created when one of these entities' servants fails in an appointed task and is transformed into a monster as punishment and example to the others. Nightgaunts look like hairless, naked humans with ebony-black skin, clawed hands and feet, bat wings sprouting from their back, and a blank, featureless oval for a face. These nocturnal creatures have a favorite tactic- swooping down upon a foe, grasping them in their foot-talons, then zooming upwards only to drop their helpless prey from a great height. Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d6, Spirit d8, Strength d8, Vigor d8 Skills: Fighting d8, Notice d6 Pace: 6; Parry: 6; Toughness: 6 Special Abilities Claws: Str+d6 Fear: Seeing these twisted creatures causes a Fear check. Flight: Nightgaunts fly at Pace 18\" with Climb 2. Improved Frenzy: Nightgaunts may make two Fighting attacks each action at no penalty. Quick: Nightgaunts are fast. They may discard Action Cards of 5 or lower and draw another. They must keep the replacement card, however.","title":"Weird Wars Rome bestiary","component":"savagery","version":"master","name":"wwr_bestiary","url":"/savagery/settings/wwr_bestiary.html","titles":[{"text":"Animals","hash":"_animals","id":1},{"text":"Boar","hash":"_boar","id":2},{"text":"Bear","hash":"_bear","id":3},{"text":"Dire Wolf","hash":"_dire_wolf","id":4},{"text":"Dog / Wolf","hash":"_dog_wolf","id":5},{"text":"Dog of war","hash":"_dog_of_war","id":6},{"text":"Horse, War","hash":"_horse_war","id":7},{"text":"Horse","hash":"_horse","id":8},{"text":"Swarm","hash":"_swarm","id":9},{"text":"Men","hash":"_men","id":10},{"text":"Roman, Auxilia","hash":"_roman_auxilia","id":11},{"text":"Roman, Centurion","hash":"_roman_centurion","id":12},{"text":"Roman, Gladiator","hash":"_roman_gladiator","id":13},{"text":"Roman, Legionary","hash":"_roman_legionary","id":14},{"text":"Roman, Legionary, Tribune","hash":"_roman_legionary_tribune","id":15},{"text":"Barbarian Archer","hash":"_barbarian_archer","id":16},{"text":"Barbarian Berserker","hash":"_barbarian_berserker","id":17},{"text":"Barbarian Charioteer","hash":"_barbarian_charioteer","id":18},{"text":"Barbarian Chieftain","hash":"_barbarian_chieftain","id":19},{"text":"Barbarian Druid/Shaman","hash":"_barbarian_druidshaman","id":20},{"text":"Barbarian Tribal King","hash":"_barbarian_tribal_king","id":21},{"text":"Barbarian Warrior","hash":"_barbarian_warrior","id":22},{"text":"Supernaturals","hash":"_supernaturals","id":23},{"text":"Banshee","hash":"_banshee","id":24},{"text":"Bog Men","hash":"_bog_men","id":25},{"text":"Fog Of War","hash":"_fog_of_war","id":26},{"text":"Fury","hash":"_fury","id":27},{"text":"Ghost","hash":"_ghost","id":28},{"text":"'Glom","hash":"_glom","id":29},{"text":"Hate","hash":"_hate","id":30},{"text":"Husk","hash":"_husk","id":31},{"text":"Hydes","hash":"_hydes","id":32},{"text":"Sluagh","hash":"_sluagh","id":33},{"text":"Werebear","hash":"_werebear","id":34},{"text":"Wereboar","hash":"_wereboar","id":35},{"text":"Will O' Wisp","hash":"_will_o_wisp","id":36},{"text":"Werewolf","hash":"_werewolf","id":37},{"text":"Wolfman","hash":"_wolfman","id":38},{"text":"Zombie","hash":"_zombie","id":39},{"text":"Monsters","hash":"_monsters","id":40},{"text":"Arbor Bellum","hash":"_arbor_bellum","id":41},{"text":"Cloud Of Hate","hash":"_cloud_of_hate","id":42},{"text":"Corpse Raven (swarm)","hash":"_corpse_raven_swarm","id":43},{"text":"Beast man","hash":"_beast_man","id":44},{"text":"Manticora","hash":"_manticora","id":45},{"text":"Nightgaunt","hash":"_nightgaunt","id":46}]},"16":{"id":16,"text":"Disclaimer As of February 2023, Pinnacle Entertainment Group has not released a document that supports the conversion of the Weird Wars Rome books from 2013, which was published for the Savage Worlds Explorer’s Edition (SWDEE), for the use with Savage Worlds Adventure Edition (SWADE). This document is not intended as a conversion document for mass consumption by Savage Worlds fans and gamers. This was drafted with the intent to support my own Weird Wars Rome campaign that will be played using SWADE. I encourage Savage Worlds enthusiasts of all stripes to purchase Weird Wars Rome (2013) from the Pinnacle Entertainment Group site. This document features excerpts of that book and is not intended to plagiarize elements from it. It also includes additional content that was adapted from the Pathfinder for Savage Worlds rules set and the Savage Worlds Fantasy Companion. The campaign focuses on a squad of auxiliaries who are attached to the legion Legio VI Victrix (\"Victorious Sixth Legion\"). This legion was stationed at Hadrian’s Wall at the end of the second century AD. Auxiliary cavalry instead of legionaries At the outset of the campaign, the players play members of a unit of auxiliary cavalry instead of legionaries. The Ala II Asturum, or second Asturian cavalry unit, was a cavalry unit from the province of Hispania (Spain). After 180 AD, this cavalry unit was based at Cilurnum (Chesters). As cavalry, they can engage in irregular operations and have some mobility to get into different types of action. As auxilia, you are one of the peregrini, a free provincial subject of the Empire. At the end of 25 years of service in the auxilia, you are awarded Roman citizenship. At the start, you play a soldier who is generally competent but relatively insignificant. You’re stationed on the frontier of a land that is far from home, family, and the burial ground of your ancestors. At the outset, the protagonists are involved in military endeavors. As the story develops, the heroes are exposed to more of the \"weird\" aspects of the world. As the arc continues, the protagonists develop a reputation as foes of the sinister forces and allies to those that oppose the evil of the elder gods. Over time, your soldier can rise to that of hero and agent, a member of the Twilight Legion. Use the Weird Wars Rome setting in https://savaged.us/. Sanity is a derived trait, which functions as mental toughness. See Sanity. Requirements Foreigner, Riding d6+, Fighting d6+ Every soldier is different Unlike many other settings, your character begins as a member of the same military unit. At first this may seem a somewhat limited choice, but the Roman military still allows for an almost unlimited variety when it comes to building your character. One soldier might be a feisty, naive adventurer; another may be a man of high birth who is running from a dark past; another may be a gregarious carouser and notorious brawler; another, a skilled combatant who is passionate about mosaics. There is nothing to prevent a solider being a gambler, explorer, hunter, horse trainer, \"reformed\" thief, messenger, casual occultist, curious scholarly type, or scientific-minded fellow. There’s no such thing as a standard legionary or auxiliary. Motivations and goals So what is my motivation? What am I doing here? Why do I care? Goals for honor and reputation Increase/maintain personal honor family honor military unit’s honor Avoid or conceal dishonor Long-term goals Survival (e.g., to retirement) Return to your family Obtain wealth Serve the gods and spirits of your belief system (e.g., the spirits of your ancestors, Mithras, the Christian God) Short-term goals Stay alive Stay sane Enjoy life Twilight legion goals Hold back the forces of darkness Understand the secrets you were not meant to know Understand what plots are at work beyond the mundane Characters who hail from Hispania speak Latin as their native tongue. Members of the auxilia cavalry have the following standard equipment. Equipment Scale mail, metal helmet, hasta (spear) and clipeus (medium shield), spatha (long sword), riding horse with scale barding. The following skills are not available to player characters in this setting: Electronics Hacking Focus Piloting Psionics Spellcasting Weird Science The Driving skill is used for the use of animal-drawn wheeled vehicles, such as chariots. The following edges are not available to player characters in this setting (though some may become available later on): Adept, Arcane Background (Any), Champion, Holy/Unholy Warrior, Martial Artist, Mr. Fix It, Rich, Rock and Roll. Edges which list any of the above as requirements are also off-limits. A few other edges have changed slightly to better fit the setting. Campaign Veteran As a Background Edge, it may only be taken at character creation, and you must have the GM’s permission to take it. Your soldier begins play at Seasoned Rank to represent his years of military service. Start with a standard Novice character, then give him four Advances. The price for this experience is that the advancements must be repaid. The first 4 Advances your hero earns are forfeited to \"pay back\" the debt. Requirements Novice, Smarts d6+, Spirit d6+, Vigor d8+, Fighting d8+, Athletics d6+ Military Family The hero’s father was a career soldier who rose to the ranks of centurio (or higher with the GM’s permission) or legatus (for parents with the Equestrian or Military Family Edge). He begins the game with a d4 in Fighting, Battle, Riding, or Athletics (player’s choice). In addition, he has +1 Persuasion when dealing with officers of centurio rank and above and to promotion rolls because of his father’s reputation. Should he fail to live up to his father’s deeds (GM’s discretion), he suffers a -2 penalty to Persuasion until he makes amends. Requirements Novice Equestrian/Patrician (Aristocrat) Rome’s social elites were Patricians (Senatorials) and Equestrians (knights). Such individuals have +2 to Persuasion trait rolls when they are dealing with those of lesser station in the Roman world. Most aristocrats have small estates that provide income (in game terms, the character wants for nothing reasonable) and somewhere to go when not on active service. Aristocrats may also find themselves subject to political maneuvers instigated both back in Rome or within the upper echelons of his legion. Requirements Novice Blood and guts The character ignores Fear tests caused by gore, and adds +1 to damage in bloody hand-to-hand combat. Requirements Veteran Combat sense Opponents halve any Gang Up bonuses against you (round down). Requirements Seasoned, Fighting d8+, Notice d8+ Improved combat sense Opponents gain no Gang Up bonus against you. Requirements Veteran, Combat Sense Mighty throw The character increases the range brackets of thrown weapons by +1/+2/+4. He also causes an extra +1 damage when using thrown weapons at targets within short range. Requirements Seasoned, Strength d8+, Athletics d10+ Formation fighter The character increases the Gang Up bonus by an additional +1 for himself and his allies. The maximum Gang Up bonus is still +4 no matter how many Formation Fighters stand together. [1] Requirements Novice, Fighting d8+ Shield wall Legionaries with the Shield Wall edge and a shield add +1 to each adjacent man’s Parry if that man has the Edge (and a shield) as well. The maximum bonus for this Edge is +2 (if there is one man to the left and right), and stacks with any Parry bonuses for the shields or weapons they hold. Requirements Novice, Roman Legionary A few good men When the GM checks to see which of the commander’s Extras are alive or dead after a fight, he may reroll any failures. This Edge affects up to 12 men; it does not stack if multiple characters have the ability. If the leader is the overall commander in a Mass Battle, roll a d6 whenever a token is lost. On a 6, the token isn’t lost. Requirements Heroic, Smarts d8+, Battle d10+, Command, Inspire Cry havoc! Once per Mass Battle, during the Battle Roll Phase, the hero may “Cry Havoc” — perhaps by ordering a certain group of his troops to charge or by inspiring them with his command. He must do this before he rolls his battle die. If he succeeds in his roll and beats his opponent, his enemy loses one extra token. Requirements Veteran, Spirit d8+, Battle d10+, Command, Fervor Death before dishonor The character has led his army to many victories and the men have come to accept retreat as a stain on their honor. The leader adds +2 to Spirit rolls when rolling for Morale in a Mass Battle. Requirements Veteran, Spirit d6+, Command, Hold the Line Fanaticism Troops under command of a character with this edge add +2 to Fear checks. Requirements Seasoned, Command, Persuasion d8+ Aquilifer The aquilifer is a veteran soldier charged with carrying the legion’s standard (aquila or eagle) and keeping it safe. The character has immunis when making camp, and when the aquila is carried the aquilifer gains the benefits of one Leadership Edge of his choice, though he must meet all the requirements. He may only choose and use one such Edge per session. His command range is equal to 5\". For each of the following edges he takes, add +1\" to the signifier’s command range: Charismatic Work the Room Work the Crowd Requirements Seasoned, Spirit d10+, Fighting d10+ Hardened The soldier regains one extra point of Sanity during “down time.” This is usually between missions, is entirely at the GM’s discretion, and is in addition to any he might gain for other reasons. Requirements Seasoned Medicus (medic) If the character with this edge can get to a wounded non-Wild Card by the end of the round in which he was wounded, he can make an immediate Healing roll at -2. If the roll is successful, the victim is just Shaken instead of wounded. Requirements Novice, Healing d6+ Rank (decanus or tribune) The the character with this edge can lead others in combat. They are also responsible for those under their command. Those who achieve rank through promotion do not automatically get the effects of the edge, but may purchase it with an advance once promoted. The Rank edge doubles the character’s command range from 5' to 10\" (or from 10\" to 20\" if he also has Command Presence). A character created with this edge begins as a decanus if he is to lead common legionaries. If the GM allows, a character who also has the Equestrian/Patrician or Military Family Edge may be a tribune instead. Tribunes rank above centurions but are rarely given command of centuries or larger unless they have the skill to lead it (typically the Battle skill at d6 or higher). This rank is usually only appropriate if the player characters are a command group either led by or composed of tribunes. Requirements Novice, Fighting d6+, Command Signifer Each century has a signum, which is a spear shaft that is decorated with the century’s awards. On top of the shaft is an open hand; the hand symbolizes the oath of loyalty that all soldiers take. The soldier who carries the signum is the signifer. The signum is a rallying point during battle. A signifer has immunis when making camp and +1 bonus to Persuasion rolls among his century. When he carries the signum, the players of the signifer can select one Leadership edge; the character must have all of the requirements for the edge. He may only choose and use one such Edge per game session. Requirements Novice, Smarts d6+, Spirit d6+, Fighting d8+ Sticky fingers The soldier adds +2 to Common Knowledge rolls made to look for Spoils. Requirements Novice Band of brothers Characters with this Edge gain +1 Toughness for each other “brother” with this ability within 6”, to a maximum of +4. For example, if four soldiers with this edge stand together, they each gain +3 Toughness. Requirements Wild Card, Veteran, Common Bond Arcane Background (Cult of Mithras) Requirements: Seasoned, Faith d4+, Spirit d6+, Fighting d6+ Arcane Skill: Faith (Spirit) Power Points: 10 Starting Powers: 2 Backlash: When a priest of Mithras rolls a 1 on his Faith die, he’s Shaken. Trappings: No visible effects beyond a slight yellowish glow. Powers List: Arcane Protection Banish Boost/lower trait Confusion Deflection Detect/conceal arcana Dispel Divination Drain Power Points Environmental protection Farsight Fear Havoc Healing Light (of Light/Darkness) Protection Relief Smite Speak language Speed (of Sloth/Speed) Stun Special rules: Sins: Priests of Mithras are subject to the usual rules for sinning described in Savage Worlds. In their case, minor sins are retreating from battle unless it’s it is certain suicide. A major sin is shirking battle — particularly with a deserving foe or creature of darkness. Working with evil is a mortal sin. The following hindrances are only suitable with the GM’s consent: Elderly, Hard of Hearing (Major), Obese, One Arm, One Eye, One Leg, Outsider, Small, Wanted, and Young. In addition, the hindrance Outsider (SWADE) is replaced by Foreigner. The SWADE hindrance Hesitant replaces the Slow hindrance, which was defined in Weird Wars Rome. Doubting Thomas (Major) Besides the description presented in Savage Worlds, Doubting Thomases are just not prepared to deal with the mind-twisting realization that these horrors could actually be real. Characters with this Hindrance suffer double Sanity loss. On the plus side, they start with a Sanity of +2. Foreigner (Major / Minor) The character isn’t a Roman citizen. She may come from outside the Roman provinces or belong to a subjugated people. He can’t be a legionary, but he may serve as a medicus, auxilia, speculatore, or similar character type. As a Minor Hindrance, the Foreigner is a Greek (the only other civilization Rome truly respected). He suffers -2 Persuasion with \"proper\" Romans but begins the game with the ability to speak Latin and his native tongue. As a Major Hindrance, the character is from outside Rome or its recognized and civilized provinces. These foreigners have -2 Persuasion with \"true\" Romans and cannot reroll Persuasion trait rolls. These characters are often sacrificed by their commanders as diversions, distractions, or to cover the retreat of the legions. All auxilia are therefore Foreigners in a Romano-centric campaign. Foreigners of either stripe can’t own slaves or serve in the legions. Besides the disadvantages listed above, Foreigners may be called on to use their local knowledge to serve the empire, perhaps betraying their own people. Replacement (Minor) Not every young soldier has this hindrance - only those who take a little longer to adjust to the realities of war. Do not deal this character an Action Card on the first round of any combat (that is, every combat is a surprise). In addition, the soldier has a -2 penalty for Notice rolls made to detect ambushes or booby traps; he also suffers the -2 penalty to most Common Knowledge rolls related to military operations. The replacement is often assigned the worst duties. Of course, the soldier doesn’t stay new forever. After each relatively active month of service, the hero makes a Smarts roll at -2. If the roll is successful, he drops one group of penalties - either the Action Card penalty or the -2 to Notice and Common Knowledge rolls. He may roll again after another active month to rid himself of the other penalty, at which point he’s no longer a replacement. Shirker (Minor) This soldier procrastinates and actively tries to dodge any sort of work, or tries to get someone else to do it for him. When forced into doing something, he attempts to finish whatever he’s doing as quickly as possible. Shirkers suffer -2 to Promotion rolls. His reputation for being lazy may not sit well with his companions or superior officers, so he has a -2 to his Persuasion with them. The following are \"character-facing\" setting rules. Setting rules for naval combat, sieges, travel, the tetsudo formation, and volley fire still apply but are not discussed here. Characters may not Soak Wounds caused by The Drop, nor may they spend Bennies to resist a Knockout Blow. See the Savage Worlds Fantasy Companion for more information. Sanity is a derived trait that monitors your character’s mental health and resilience. A soldier’s starting Sanity is 2 plus half his Spirit die type unless modified by edges and hindrances. If a character increases his Spirit after character generation, it increases Sanity by one point as well. As a character faces various horrors, his Sanity may change. If his current Sanity reaches 0, he suffers a Disorder. Every time a Fear test is failed, the character suffers the usual effects and also loses a point of Sanity (or two with a critical failure). Recovery If a character has at least one point of Sanity and goes two game months without losing any more, he regains 1 point of Sanity. He may also spend Spoils to recover Sanity (see Indulgence). When Sanity reaches 0, the soldier cannot recover normally. He must spend time in a sanctum of some sort, such as a temple or famous philosopher’s home. At the end of each month, he may make a single Smarts roll at -2 (reflecting the primitive stage of psychology in this era). If successful, he removes one of his Disorders (see Disorders). If he removes all of his Disorders, he gains a point of Sanity instead and may then recover normally. Over the Edge If a character Sanity slips too far, he can become dangerously unhinged. Characters with a Sanity of 1 or 2 are noticeably odd. People don’t feel comfortable around them and they have a hard time fitting in. Should a character’s Sanity drop below 0, he must roll on the Disorders Table. If duplicate results are rolled, the problem becomes worse. Sanity cannot drop below 0, but each time it would, the character suffers a new Disorder instead. Table 1. Disorders d20 Result 1-3 Superstitious Your character has found something that helps him deal with the terrors he faces. Pick a simple routine or object to be the focus of this disorder. As long as the focus is undisturbed, this soldier can function normally. If the focus is lost or disturbed his trait rolls are modified by -1 for this mission. 4-6 Thousand-Yard Stare The distant look in this soldier’s eyes speaks volumes about the horrors he’s seen. This soldier makes all his Notice rolls at -2. 7-8 Flashbacks This legionary is overwhelmed by images of past battles and dead comrades. In combat, images flash through his mind, confusing the past with reality. He must make a Spirit test at -4 or gain the Hesitant hindrance for the remainder of the battle. 9-10 Distant This legionary has been through many units and many comrades in the course of his career. He finds it difficult to form relationships. Viewed as a bit of a wet blanket in the best situations, this soldier suffers a -2 penalty to his Persuasion and cannot spend a benny to reroll a Persuasion check. 11-12 Night Terrors This character has been traumatized by past events and cannot sleep properly without some kind of sedative. As a result, the individual is permanently tired. When it is important to sleep, a failed Vigor roll (-2) means this character cannot. 13-14 Addiction Many legionaries deal with their mental pain and stress with strong wine or other narcotics. The character has a Major Habit Hindrance. 15-16 The Shakes During combat or anytime the character is under stress (determined by the GM) his hands start shaking, reducing all Agility and Agility-related skill rolls by -2. 17-18 Paranoia This legionary has seen things in the course of his duty that his superiors have refused to explain. He feels that every unexplained or odd action has a deeper meaning and goes to great lengths to fit them into his skewed perception of the world around him. He gets the Major Delusional hindrance, as well as a -2 to his Persuasion. 19-20 Blood Lust Bloody battle has awakened a strange lust within this veteran. He has the Bloodthirsty hindrance and a Minor Habit for killing. The individual battle honors can be won. When any major awards is first granted, the character receives one advance. When worn, the legionary adds +2 to his Persuasion (+4 for the corona graminea). Corona Muralis Awarded to the first soldier to scale the walls of a besieged enemy fortification. Corona Navalis Awarded to the first soldier to board an enemy ship during combat. Corona Civica Awarded to soldiers who saved the lives of their fellow soldiers (a minimum of a contubernium) in the face of the enemy. Recipients are required to wear it at all civic functions. Corona Graminea Awarded to soldiers (usually of centurio rank or higher) whose actions saved an entire legion. Recipients of this award draw one additional Benny per session (this stacks with Luck). Triumph To be awarded a triumph (parade) the soldier had to be a legatus, have scored a victory over a significant foreign power, and be an elected magistrate. Should a character be awarded a triumph, he gains a point of Conviction and gains an extra advance, and makes many powerful friends and enemies.[2] This award is out of reach of most characters. Minor awards and honors can be earned for distinguishing oneself in military action. Examples of lesser awards include: armillae (armbands) phalerae (sculpted discs worn on armor during parades) golden cups silver flags These items count as a Spoil that the legionary can use (i.e., \"cash in\") once. The legionary does not lose his award once spent, but he can’t gain any other benefit from it. After a Wild Card engages in an authorized conflict under the command of a superior officer, roll a d20. On a result of 20+, the character’s actions earned distinction and he gains a lesser award as above. Apply the following modifiers to the d20 roll. Table 2. Award modifiers Modifier Event +1 Saved the life of a non-citizen ally +1 Saved the life of a fellow soldier +1 Saved the life of a superior officer +1 Defeated 3+ Extra foes without aid +2 Defeated a Wild Card foe without aid +4 Defeated a Wild Card opposing leader without aid +2 Exemplary actions viewed by more than one superior (per superior) When a character receives an award, roll a d20 and add +2 for each Leadership edge he possesses and a bonus equal to the Persuasion modifier that his combined awards grant him. He may also add +1 for each Spoil he cares to \"share\" to ensure that he’s noticed by his superiors or those around him. On a roll of 20 or higher, the character has distinguished himself. If there’s an opening and the GM allows it, he’s promoted a rank (with all the responsibility the rank entails). The character does not get the Rank edge for free, but may choose it as an advance, ignoring the Command edge requirement. If a spot isn’t available or an advance in rank isn’t appropriate, the character instead receives 1d4+1 Spoils as a reward for service. A character who starts as a legionary cannot rise above primi ordino rank without enlisting for a second tour; most will likely never rise above optio. See Military ranks. Spoils are treasures legionaries collect beyond their normal pay. Spoils is an abstraction and represent a somewhat random assortment of coins, jewelry, objects of art, or even money from captives sold to bands of slavers who always followed the legions on campaign. The GM provides the players tokens to track their Spoils. Each Spoil weighs two pounds and must be carried and watched like all other gear. A character can spend a Spoil on any of the actions below when appropriate and with the GM’s permission. Each action costs one Spoil, does not stack with itself, and generally cannot be repeated for at least a month of game time. Blessing The character makes a donation to the local temple or priest of his chosen deity. He adds +1 to Spirit and all Spirit-based rolls for the next game month. Carousing While on leave, the soldier parties hards. He gains a Benny that may be saved between sessions until used. Celebrated The soldier finds someone who is willing to tell the stories of the soldier’s prowess and success. The soldier becomes a minor celebrity in a specific and limited place (e.g., quarter of a city, limited territorial region). He receives a +1 to Persuasion rolls if a target is friendly and knows who he is (a Common Knowledge roll modified by how likely the individual is to know the celebrity).[3] Immunis The soldier pays a superior to grant him immunity from camp work for a week if on the march, or a month if in camp. Indulgence The character spends a Spoil on something meaningful—helping someone less fortunate or a personal interest. This strengthens his mental resolve and recovers one lost point of Sanity. Rest and Recuperation If the soldier has been stricken with a disease, illness, or Fatigue, he may spend a spoil to get the best medical care, unguents, and medicines. With a successful Vigor roll, all Fatigue and illness is removed. No refund is due if the roll is failed. The character unleashes a frantic attack that focuses on hitting a target at the expense of damage. He adds +2 or +4 to any Fighting roll and subtracts the corresponding amount from damage if the hit is successful. This can be determined per attack (before rolling); it can’t be combined with the Wild Attack combat maneuver. [4] The core of each legion was made up of full-time, highly disciplined, professional soldiers. Rome had a varying number of legions over the years, ranging from four to as many as 60. Numbers in parentheses are the typical number of legionaries within the individual formations during the late Republic and early Imperial eras (see the sidebar on page 8 for the early Republic). In general, 10 contubernii make up a century, six centuries make up a cohort, and ten cohorts make up a legion. Contubernium (8) The smallest group within the legion was the \"tent group\", made up of eight soldiers. The name comes from the fact that each contubernium shared a single tent when on the march. Each unit also shared a millstone and cooking pot, carried by a mule assigned to the unit. Century (80) Despite the name, a century was usually formed of 80 actual soldiers and 20 noncombatant cooks and other servants. Led by a centurio (centurions), it was broken down into 8-10 contuberniums. Each century had a signum, a standard which served as a rallying point and carried their battle honors. Cohort (480) Six centuries made a cohort, the largest formation within a legion. Each cohort was led by a pilus prior, a senior centurio. The first cohort is double strength (800—960 men depending on period), made up of six 160-man centuries. Legion (5280—6000) Ten cohorts made a legion. Each legion had a single standard, the aquila (eagle). This carried the legion’s battle honors and was highly revered. Loss of the aquila could lead to the legion being disgraced and disbanded. As well as legionaries, each legion was supported by auxilia, comprising foreign soldiers and specialist troops. A typical legion was supported by auxilia equal in number to the legionaries. Among the auxilia were Balearic slingers, archers, cavalry, as well as velites, skirmishers wearing little armor and armed with javelins. These were usually placed into cohorts of 500 or 1,000 men and commanded by a Roman officer. Specialist troops included engineers, medics, priests, and speculatores. They were organized into smaller groups, from a single man or contubernium up to about a century. Every legion also had an extensive mule train, with each contubernium having its own mule, on which was loaded the unit’s tent, mill stone, cooking pot, and extra rations. Artillery A typical legion had one onager (light catapult) per cohort (six per legion) and one scorpio (light ballista) per century (60 per legion). These were carried on carts drawn by mules. Each artillery piece was manned by artillerists, and had a compliment of carpenters to enact repairs or construct new siege engines. Player characters are members of an ala (cavalry). Table 3. Ranks within the ala Rank level Rank name Latin rank name 0 Cavalryman (common soldier) gregalis 1 Corporal sesquiplicarius 2 Sergeant duplicarius 2 turma standard-bearer signifer 2 decurion’s deputy curator 2 ala standard-bearer vexillarius 3 turma commander decurio 4 chief decurion decurio princeps 5 deputy ala commander beneficiarius 6 ala commander praefectus or tribunus For reference see Auxilia and Turma. Table 4. Building blocks of an ala Unit type Number of sub-units Sub-unit strength Unit strength Ala quingenaria 16 turmae 30 (32) 480 (512) Ala milliaria 24 turmae 30 (32) 720 (768) A turma is divided into three 10-man files. In game terms, the 10-man file in the cavalry is the equivalent of the 8-man contubernium in the legion and infantry. For reference see Auxilia. The following were the common military ranks used within the legions. Numbers in parentheses after the title indicate how many served in a typical legion. The standard early Imperial model is used. Miles Gregarius Literally meaning \"common soldier\", this is the term for a legionary without any rank. Decanus (480) The lowest rank within the legions is the decanus, who led a contubernium. In a cavalry ala, a decurio commands 30 men turma. This is the highest rank characters can begin the game. Tesserarius (60) Each century had a tesserarius, who served as a sergeant of the watch and assistant to the century’s optio, taking his place if the optio fell in battle or was sick. They are third in command of a century. Optio (60) Second in command to a centurio, and thus the second highest officer within a century. As well as filling the centurio’s sandals should he be incapable of command, they also relieved him of many mundane duties, such as training and administration. Centurio (45) Each century of a legion is commanded by a centurio, though select individuals held special titles (see below). Like modern day sergeants, they were the backbone of the army, handling the day-to-day running of the legion as well as commanding men in the field. Many were appointed through the ranks, meaning they were excellent soldiers who already had the loyalty of their men, but some were appointed to the post by a higher power, which did not always sit well with the men they commanded. For the auxiliary cavalry alae units, a turma of about 30 men was commanded by a decurio, which is the relative equivalent of a centurio. See Decurion. Primus Ordino (5) The five centurios in charge of the second to sixth centuries of the first cohort held the title primi ordines. Pilus Prior (9) The centurio of the first century within each cohort was the pilus prior. Primus Pilum (1) The \"First Spear\" (more correctly, \"first file\") was the senior centurio of the legion, and the highest rank an enlisted man could achieve. He commanded the first cohort and was fourth in command of the legion. Tribunus (5) Tribunes served as adjutants to the legatus. In most cases they were staff officers, handling the running of the camp under the camp prefect, but some were given command of a cohort in battle. This is the rank given to those characters who choose the Rank (Officer) Edge during character generation. Praefectus Castrorum (1) Translated as \"camp prefect,\" this post was usually held by a long-serving career soldier, often a primus pilum who had served his time and had been promoted as reward. He was typically in charge of training or given tactical command, and was third in command of the legion itself. Tribunus Laticlavius (1) Senior tribune, and second in command of the legion. Literally, it means \"Broad Band Tribune,\" due to the striped tunic typically worn by these men. Legatus Legionis (1) The highest rank within the legion and one appointed by the Emperor or Senate (depending on the era). Not all had military experience, so the camp prefect was often the true military commander. Many legati were provincial governors or consuls, commanding a single legion raised to protect that province. Legatus Augusti pro Praetore An \"Imperial Legate\" appointed by the Senate or Emperor in charge of multiple legions. He was usually the governor of the legions' province as well. Signifer Standard bearer for a century. His rank put him slightly above that of a legionary, but he had little command authority. Aquilifer Despite carrying the legion’s standard, he ranked only slightly higher than a signifer (though he earned more). Praefectus Commanded an auxilia ala or cohort. He held a rank similar in authority to that of a tribunus and was always a Roman. In a game where all the characters are auxilia, a character with Rank (Military Tribune) receives this rank. The Roman navy used far fewer ranks than the legions. Miles Classicus A common marine. Centurio Classicus A centurio in command of a marine century. Navarchus The captain of single warship. Praefectus Classis The Roman equivalent of an admiral, this officer commanded a fleet.

Most of the rules can be used as-is. Those that require a little more work are detailed below. Where core rules differ, the Game Master can use whichever version she prefers. Both versions will work just fine in your game, though those presented in SWADE are a bit more structured and streamlined. This is a living document. If you see something we missed, please tell us on the Pinnacle forums! Racial abilities, skills, Edges, Hindrances, and gear should be converted to their SWADE equivalents. Knowledge (Battle) becomes Battle, for example, and Tracking is Survival. If a character has two skills that have been merged into one in SWADE (such as Survival and Tracking), use the higher of the two values for the new skill. If a being has an Edge or Hindrance without an obvious equivalent in SWADE, you can either ignore it or give it a new one you feel has the same general theme. Unless otherwise stated, intelligent beings have Common Knowledge and Persuasion at d6, and all beings have Athletics, Notice, and Stealth at d6. The War Master should increase this to the linked attribute (or higher) if she feels it’s appropriate. Any bonus or penalty to Charisma is applied to the specified Persuasion rolls instead. Special Abilities such as Undead, or those that mimic Edges such as Frenzy, should use the updated versions presented in SWADE. The following skills are not available to player characters in this setting: Electronics Hacking Focus Piloting Psionics Spellcasting Weird Science The Driving skill is used for the use of animal-drawn wheeled vehicles, such as chariots. Slow Use Hesitant from SWADE instead. Foreigner (Major / Minor) As a Minor Hindrance, the Foreigner is a Greek. He suffers -2 Persuasion with \"proper\" Romans but begins the game with the ability to speak Latin and his native tongue. As a Major Hindrance, the character is from outside Rome (or from its recognized and civilized provinces). These foreigners have -2 Persuasion with \"true\" Romans and cannot reroll Persuasion trait rolls.

For each of the following edges he takes, add +1\" to the signifier’s command range:[3] Charismatic Work the Room Work the Crowd Shields Treat the clipeus as a medium shield per SWADE.

When any major award is first granted, the character receives one advance. When worn, the soldier adds +2 to his Persuasion (+4 for the corona graminea) to anyone who recognizes the significance of the award. When a character receives an award, roll a d20 and add +2 for each Leadership Edge he possesses and a bonus equal to the Persuasion modifier his combined awards grant him (such as that granted by the corona muralis, for example). Triumph Should a character be awarded a triumph, he gains a point of Conviction and gains an extra advance, and makes many powerful friends and enemies.[5] Remove the Experience action Add the Celebrated action. Celebrated The soldier finds someone who is willing to tell the stories of the soldier’s prowess and success. The soldier becomes a minor celebrity in a specific and limited place (e.g., quarter of a city, limited territorial region). He receives a +1 to Persuasion rolls if a target is friendly and knows who he is (a Common Knowledge roll modified by how likely the individual is to know the celebrity).[6] Arcane Background (Cult of Mithras) Powers List: The SWDEE Quickness power is removed; in SWADE, Quickness is a modifier of the Speed/Sloth power. Add Arcane Protection [7] Changes to power names Havoc (was Pummel in SWDEE) Protection (was Armor in SWDEE) Relief (was Succor in SWDEE) Light (of SWADE Light/Darkness) Speed (of SWADE Sloth/Speed) Arbor Bellum Add the Entangle special ability. The creature adds +2 to any Grappling rolls. Stomp should be Str+d8 (i.e., not Str+8). Corpse Raven (swarm) Flight: Pace 12.[8] Harpy Flight: Pace 12.[9] Jaculus Add Athletics at d8. Kludde Add Athletics at d8. Manticora Add Athletics at d8. Mermaid Add Performance at d12. Siren Song: The mermaid’s song is like a narcotic for men. The mermaid sings and the character(s) who hears the song must resist (Performance versus Spirit) or fall under the spell of the song. Strigoi (Dacian vampire) Use Vampire from SWADE p. 189 but with the following changes: Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d10, Spirit d10, Strength d12+2, Vigor d10 Skills: Athletics d8, Common Knowledge d6, Fighting d8, Intimidation d8, Notice d8, Persuasion d6, Stealth d6 Pace: 6; Parry: 7; Toughness: 13(3) Edges: Block, Combat Reflexes, Command, Fervor, Frenzy, Level Headed, Aristocrat, Rich, Sweep Gear: Bronze breastplate (+3), medium shield (+2 Parry), great falx (Str+d10). Special Abilities: Bite: Str+d4. Undead: +2 Toughness; +2 to recover from being Shaken; no additional damage from Called Shots; ignores 1 point of Wound penalties; doesn’t breathe; immune to disease and poison. Other abilities for the Strigoi as the entry in Weird Wars Rome. Stryge Flight: Pace 12.[10] Werebear Add Athletics at d8. Bear Hug: A werebear who hits with a Fighting attack and also succeeds a raise has pinned (i.e., Entangled and Bound) his foe and may bite at +2 until the foe is freed. The opponent may only attempt to escape the hug on his action. To completely break free of the bear hug, the victim of the hug must improve his status so that he is no longer Bound nor Entangled. The werebear resists attempts to break free using Strength. The werebear is not subject to the customary -2 penalty when using Strength in grappling. Keep in mind the \"Size Matters\" rules under Grappling on SWADE p. 101. Wolfman Add Athletics at d8. 1. This was framed in terms of experience points in SWDEE. 2. There may be an occasion here to leverage the settings rules for status from Rippers Resurrected to handle high status classes versus the plebeians. 3. This replaces the use of the SWDEE Charisma stat to increase the command radius. 4. The uses the stats for the quinquereme from the SWADE Vehicle Guide P14 5. For \"making many powerful friends and enemies\", there may need to be some mechanic with reputation/glory/renown. 6. This functions like a more limited Fame edge from SWADE p39. 7. I added the Arcane Protection power because Quickness was removed; the Mithras cultist has the same number of powers available as before. 8. In WWR, the harpy and the corpse raven had flight pace of 8; in Pathfinder for Savage Worlds Bestiary p.73, the harpy is listed with a flight pace of 12 so I have use the same for the corpse raven. 9. In Pathfinder for Savage Worlds Bestiary p.73 , Harpy is listed with a flight pace of 12. 10. In WWR, the harpy and the stryge had flight pace of 8; in Pathfinder for Savage Worlds Bestiary p.73, the harpy is listed with a flight pace of 12 so I have use the same for the stryge.","title":"Weird Wars Rome Conversion","component":"savagery","version":"master","name":"wwr_swade_conversion","url":"/savagery/settings/wwr_swade_conversion.html","titles":[{"text":"General Notes","hash":"_general_notes","id":1},{"text":"Creatio Militis (Military Personnel)","hash":"_creatio_militis_military_personnel","id":2},{"text":"Traits","hash":"_traits","id":3},{"text":"Hindrances","hash":"_hindrances","id":4},{"text":"Edges","hash":"_edges","id":5},{"text":"Background edges","hash":"_background_edges","id":6},{"text":"Combat Edges","hash":"_combat_edges","id":7},{"text":"Professional edges","hash":"_professional_edges","id":8},{"text":"Arma","hash":"_arma","id":9},{"text":"Praescripta Mundi (Setting Rules)","hash":"_praescripta_mundi_setting_rules","id":10},{"text":"Awards and Promotions","hash":"_awards_and_promotions","id":11},{"text":"Awards and honors","hash":"_awards_and_honors","id":12},{"text":"Promotion","hash":"_promotion","id":13},{"text":"Spoils","hash":"_spoils","id":14},{"text":"Arcana (Secrets)","hash":"_arcana_secrets","id":15},{"text":"Beasts et Monsters","hash":"_beasts_et_monsters","id":16}]}},"components":{},"componentVersions":{"savagery/master":{"displayVersion":"master","title":"Savage Worlds Content","version":"master","name":"savagery","asciidoc":{"attributes":{"env":"site","env-site":"","site-gen":"antora","site-gen-antora":"","attribute-missing":"warn","data-uri":null,"icons":"font","sectanchors":"","source-highlighter":"highlight.js","site-title":"Savage Worlds of the Roxville Rooster","site-url":"https://roxvillerooster.github.io/antora_home/savagery"},"sourcemap":false},"url":"/savagery/index.html","navigation":[{"items":[{"content":"Home","url":"/savagery/index.html","urlType":"internal"}],"root":true,"order":0},{"items":[{"content":"Classic two-fisted pulp adventures","url":"/savagery/settings/pulp_setting_rules.html","urlType":"internal","items":[{"content":"Playing the pulp action game","url":"/savagery/settings/pulp_intro.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Create your pulp hero","url":"/savagery/settings/pulp_character_creation.html","urlType":"internal","items":[{"content":"Archetypes for pulp action characters","url":"/savagery/settings/pulp_archetypes.html","urlType":"internal"}]},{"content":"Equipment and Vehicles","url":"/savagery/settings/pulp_stuff.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"References","url":"/savagery/settings/pulp_colophon.html","urlType":"internal"}]},{"content":"Firefly","url":"/savagery/settings/firefly_swade.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Musketeers","url":"/savagery/settings/Savage_Musketeers.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Rocketeers","url":"/savagery/settings/Savage_Three_Rocketeers.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Weird Wars Rome","items":[{"content":"Weird Wars Rome Conversion","url":"/savagery/settings/wwr_swade_conversion.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Campaign for Weird Wars Rome - Beyond the Wall","url":"/savagery/settings/wwr_campaign.html","urlType":"internal"}]},{"content":"Savage Espionage","url":"/savagery/settings/savage_espionage.html","urlType":"internal"}],"root":true,"order":1},{"items":[{"content":"Wealth","url":"/savagery/rules/wealth_sw.html","urlType":"internal"}],"root":true,"order":2},{"items":[{"content":"VTT","items":[{"content":"VTT play","url":"/savagery/ops/VTT_considerations.html","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Roll20","url":"/savagery/ops/roll20.html","urlType":"internal"}]}],"root":true,"order":3}]}}}})
