<div class="title">Disclaimer</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As of February 2023, Pinnacle Entertainment Group has not released a document that supports the conversion of the Weird Wars Rome books from 2013, which was published for the Savage Worlds Explorer&#8217;s Edition (SWDEE), for the use with Savage Worlds Adventure Edition (SWADE).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This document is not intended as a conversion document for mass consumption by Savage Worlds fans and gamers.
This was drafted with the intent to support my own Weird Wars Rome campaign that will be played using SWADE.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I encourage Savage Worlds enthusiasts of all stripes to purchase Weird Wars Rome (2013) from the <a href="https://peginc.com/product-category/weird-wars-rome/">Pinnacle Entertainment Group site</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This document features excerpts of that book and is not intended to plagiarize elements from it.
It also includes additional content that was adapted from the <a href="https://peginc.com/savage-settings/savage-pathfinder/">Pathfinder for Savage Worlds</a> rules set and the <a href="https://peginc.com/product-category/savage-worlds-companions/fantasy-companion/">Savage Worlds Fantasy Companion</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The campaign focuses on a squad of auxiliaries who are attached to the legion <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legio_VI_Victrix"><em>Legio VI Victrix</em></a> ("Victorious Sixth Legion").
This legion was stationed at Hadrian&#8217;s Wall at the end of the second century AD.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">Auxiliary cavalry instead of legionaries</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the outset of the campaign, the players play members of a unit of auxiliary cavalry instead of legionaries.
The <em>Ala II Asturum</em>, or second Asturian cavalry unit, was a cavalry unit from the province of Hispania (Spain).
After 180 AD, this cavalry unit was based at Cilurnum (Chesters).
As cavalry, they can engage in irregular operations and have some mobility to get into different types of action.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As <em>auxilia</em>, you are one of the <em>peregrini</em>, a free provincial subject of the Empire.
At the end of 25 years of service in the <em>auxilia</em>, you are awarded Roman citizenship.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the start, you play a soldier who is generally competent but relatively insignificant.
You&#8217;re stationed on the frontier of a land that is far from home, family, and the burial ground of your ancestors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the outset, the protagonists are involved in military endeavors.
As the story develops, the heroes are exposed to more of the "weird" aspects of the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the arc continues, the protagonists develop a reputation as foes of the sinister forces and allies to those that oppose the evil of the elder gods.
Over time, your soldier can rise to that of hero and agent, a member of the Twilight Legion.</p>

<div class="title">Every soldier is different</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unlike many other settings, your character begins as a member of the same military unit.
At first this may seem a somewhat limited choice, but the Roman military still allows for an almost unlimited variety when it comes to building your character.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One soldier might be a feisty, naive adventurer; another may be a man of high birth who is running from a dark past; another may be a gregarious carouser and notorious brawler; another, a skilled combatant who is passionate about mosaics.</p>

<p>There is nothing to prevent a solider being a gambler, explorer, hunter, horse trainer, "reformed" thief, messenger, casual occultist, curious scholarly type, or scientific-minded fellow.
There&#8217;s no such thing as a standard legionary or auxiliary.</p>

<p>As a Background Edge, it may only be taken at character creation, and you must have the GM&#8217;s permission to take it.
Your soldier begins play at Seasoned Rank to represent his years of military service.
Start with a standard Novice character, then give him four Advances.
The price for this experience is that the advancements must be repaid.
The first 4 Advances your hero earns are forfeited to "pay back" the debt.</p>

<p>The hero&#8217;s father was a career soldier who rose to the ranks of centurio (or higher with the GM&#8217;s permission) or legatus (for parents with the Equestrian or Military Family Edge).
He begins the game with a d4 in Fighting, Battle, Riding, or Athletics (player&#8217;s choice).
In addition, he has +1 Persuasion when dealing with officers of centurio rank and above and to promotion rolls because of his father&#8217;s reputation.
Should he fail to live up to his father&#8217;s deeds (GM&#8217;s discretion), he suffers a -2 penalty to Persuasion until he makes amends.</p>

<p>Rome&#8217;s social elites were Patricians (Senatorials) and Equestrians (knights).
Such individuals have +2 to Persuasion trait rolls when they are dealing with those of lesser station in the Roman world.
Most aristocrats have small estates that provide income (in game terms, the character wants for nothing reasonable) and somewhere to go when not on active service.
Aristocrats may also find themselves subject to political maneuvers instigated both back in Rome or within the upper echelons of his legion.</p>

<p>The Rank edge doubles the character&#8217;s command range from 5' to 10" (or from 10" to 20" if he also has Command Presence).<br>
A character created with this edge begins as a <em>decanus</em> if he is to lead common legionaries.
If the GM allows, a character who also has the Equestrian/Patrician or Military Family Edge may be a tribune instead.<br>
Tribunes rank above centurions but are rarely given command of centuries or larger unless they have the skill to lead it (typically the Battle skill at d6 or higher).

Priests of Mithras are subject to the usual rules for sinning described in Savage Worlds.
In their case, minor sins are retreating from battle unless it&#8217;s it is certain suicide.
A major sin is shirking battle — particularly with a deserving foe or creature of darkness.
Working with evil is a mortal sin.</p>

<p>Besides the description presented in Savage Worlds, Doubting Thomases are just not prepared to deal with the mind-twisting realization that these horrors could actually be real.
Characters with this Hindrance suffer double Sanity loss.
On the plus side, they start with a Sanity of +2.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Foreigner (Major / Minor)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The character isn&#8217;t a Roman citizen. She may come from outside the Roman provinces or belong to a subjugated people.
He can&#8217;t be a legionary, but he may serve as a medicus, auxilia, speculatore, or similar character type.
As a Minor Hindrance, the Foreigner is a Greek (the only other civilization Rome truly respected).
He suffers -2 Persuasion with "proper" Romans but begins the game with the ability to speak Latin and his native tongue.
As a Major Hindrance, the character is from outside Rome or its recognized and civilized provinces.
These foreigners have -2 Persuasion with "true" Romans and cannot reroll Persuasion trait rolls.
These characters are often sacrificed by their commanders as diversions, distractions, or to cover the retreat of the legions.
All <em>auxilia</em> are therefore Foreigners in a Romano-centric campaign.
Foreigners of either stripe can&#8217;t own slaves or serve in the legions.
Besides the disadvantages listed above, Foreigners may be called on to use their local knowledge to serve the empire, perhaps betraying their own people.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Replacement (Minor)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Not every young soldier has this hindrance - only those who take a little longer to adjust to the realities of war.
Do not deal this character an Action Card on the first round of any combat (that is, every combat is a surprise).
In addition, the soldier has a -2 penalty for Notice rolls made to detect ambushes or booby traps; he also suffers the -2 penalty to most Common Knowledge rolls related to military operations.
The replacement is often assigned the worst duties.
Of course, the soldier doesn&#8217;t stay new forever.
After each relatively active month of service, the hero makes a Smarts roll at -2.
If the roll is successful, he drops one group of penalties - either the Action Card penalty or the -2 to Notice and Common Knowledge rolls.
He may roll again after another active month to rid himself of the other penalty, at which point he&#8217;s no longer a replacement.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Shirker (Minor)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This soldier procrastinates and actively tries to dodge any sort of work, or tries to get someone else to do it for him.
When forced into doing something, he attempts to finish whatever he&#8217;s doing as quickly as possible.
Shirkers suffer -2 to Promotion rolls.
His reputation for being lazy may not sit well with his companions or superior officers, so he has a -2 to his Persuasion with them.</p>

<p>If a character has at least one point of Sanity and goes two game months without losing any more, he regains 1 point of Sanity.
He may also spend Spoils to recover Sanity (see <a href="#sanity_recover">Indulgence</a>).
When Sanity reaches 0, the soldier cannot recover normally.
He must spend time in a sanctum of some sort, such as a temple or famous philosopher&#8217;s home.
At the end of each month, he may make a single Smarts roll at -2 (reflecting the primitive stage of psychology in this era).
If successful, he removes one of his Disorders (see <a href="#disorder_table">Disorders</a>).
If he removes all of his Disorders, he gains a point of Sanity instead and may then recover normally.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Over the Edge</dt>
<dd>
<p>If a character Sanity slips too far, he can become dangerously unhinged.
Characters with a Sanity of 1 or 2 are noticeably odd.
People don&#8217;t feel comfortable around them and they have a hard time fitting in.
Should a character&#8217;s Sanity drop below 0, he must roll on the Disorders Table.
If duplicate results are rolled, the problem becomes worse.
Sanity cannot drop below 0, but each time it would, the character suffers a new Disorder instead.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The core of each legion was made up of full-time, highly disciplined, professional soldiers. Rome had a varying number of legions over the years, ranging from four to as many as 60. Numbers in parentheses are the typical number of legionaries within the individual formations during the late Republic and early Imperial eras (see the sidebar on page 8 for the early Republic).
In general, 10 <em>contubernii</em> make up a century, six centuries make up a cohort, and ten cohorts make up a legion.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Contubernium (8)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The smallest group within the legion was the "tent group", made up of eight soldiers.
The name comes from the fact that each contubernium shared a single tent when on the march. Each unit also shared a millstone and cooking pot, carried by a mule assigned to the unit.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Century (80)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Despite the name, a century was usually formed of 80 actual soldiers and 20
noncombatant cooks and other servants.
Led by a centurio (centurions), it was broken down into 8-10 contuberniums.
Each century had a <em>signum</em>, a standard which served as a rallying point and carried their battle honors.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Cohort (480)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Six centuries made a cohort, the largest formation within a legion.
Each cohort was led by a pilus prior, a senior centurio.
The first cohort is double strength (800—960 men depending on period), made up of six 160-man centuries.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Legion (5280—6000)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Ten cohorts made a legion.
Each legion had a single standard, the <em>aquila</em> (eagle).
This carried the legion&#8217;s battle honors and was highly revered.
Loss of the aquila could lead to the legion being disgraced and disbanded.</p>

<h2 id="_auxiliaries"><a class="anchor" href="#_auxiliaries"></a>Appendix B: Auxiliaries</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As well as legionaries, each legion was supported by <em>auxilia</em>, comprising foreign soldiers and specialist troops.
A typical legion was supported by auxilia equal in number to the legionaries.
Among the auxilia were Balearic slingers, archers, cavalry, as well as <em>velites</em>, skirmishers
wearing little armor and armed with javelins.
These were usually placed into cohorts of 500 or 1,000 men and commanded by a Roman
officer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Specialist troops included engineers, medics, priests, and <em>speculatores</em>.
They were organized into smaller groups, from a single man or contubernium up to about a century.
Every legion also had an extensive mule train, with each contubernium having its own mule, on which was loaded the unit&#8217;s tent, mill stone, cooking pot, and extra rations.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Artillery</dt>
<dd>
<p>A typical legion had one <em>onager</em> (light catapult) per cohort (six per legion) and one <em>scorpio</em> (light ballista) per century (60 per legion).
These were carried on carts drawn by mules.
Each artillery piece was manned by artillerists, and had a compliment of carpenters to enact repairs or construct new siege engines.</p>

The standard early Imperial model is used.</p>

<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Miles Gregarius</dt>
<dd>
<p>Literally meaning "common soldier", this is the term for a legionary without any rank.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Decanus (480)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The lowest rank within the legions is the <em>decanus</em>, who led a <em>contubernium</em>.<br>
In a cavalry <em>ala</em>, a <em>decurio</em> commands 30 men <em>turma</em>.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the highest rank characters can begin the game.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Tesserarius (60)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Each century had a <em>tesserarius</em>, who served as a sergeant of the watch and assistant to the century&#8217;s <em>optio</em>, taking his place if the optio fell in battle or was sick.
They are third in command of a century.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Optio (60)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Second in command to a <em>centurio</em>, and thus the second highest officer within a century.
As well as filling the centurio&#8217;s sandals should he be incapable of command, they also relieved him of many mundane duties, such as training and administration.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Centurio (45)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Each century of a legion is  commanded by a <em>centurio</em>, though select individuals held special titles (see below).
Like modern day sergeants, they were the backbone of the army, handling the day-to-day running
of the legion as well as commanding men in the field.
Many were appointed through the ranks, meaning they were excellent soldiers who already had the loyalty of their men, but some were appointed to the post by a higher power, which did not always sit well with the men they commanded.
For the auxiliary cavalry <em>alae</em> units, a <em>turma</em> of about 30 men was commanded by a <em>decurio</em>, which is the relative equivalent of a <em>centurio</em>.
See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decurion_(Roman_cavalry_officer)">Decurion</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Primus Ordino (5)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The five centurios in charge of the second to sixth centuries of the first cohort held the title primi ordines.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Pilus Prior (9)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The centurio of the first century within each cohort was the pilus prior.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Primus Pilum (1)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The "First Spear" (more correctly, "first file") was the senior centurio of the legion, and the highest rank an enlisted man could achieve.
He commanded the first cohort and was fourth in command of the legion.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Tribunus (5)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Tribunes served as adjutants to the legatus.
In most cases they were staff officers, handling the running of the camp under the camp prefect, but some were given command of a cohort in battle.
This is the rank given to those characters who choose the Rank (Officer) Edge during character generation.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Praefectus Castrorum (1)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Translated as "camp prefect," this post was usually held by a long-serving career soldier, often a primus pilum who had served his time and had been promoted as reward.
He was typically in charge of training or given tactical command, and was third in command of the legion itself.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Tribunus Laticlavius (1)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Senior tribune, and second in command of the legion.
Literally, it means "Broad Band Tribune," due to the striped tunic typically worn by these men.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Legatus Legionis (1)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The highest rank within the legion and one appointed by the Emperor or Senate (depending on the era).
Not all had military experience, so the camp prefect was often the true military commander. Many legati were provincial governors or consuls, commanding a single legion raised to protect
that province.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Legatus Augusti pro Praetore</dt>
<dd>
<p>An "Imperial Legate" appointed by the Senate or Emperor in charge of multiple legions. He was usually the governor of the legions' province as well.</p>
