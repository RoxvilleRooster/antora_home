Edges: -<br>
Special Abilities<br>
Bite or Sting: Swarms inflict hundreds of tiny bites every round to their victims, hitting automatically and causing 2d4 damage to everyone in the template. Damage is applied to the least armored location (victims in completely sealed suits are immune).<br>
Split: Some swarms split into two smaller swarms when Wounded (GM&#8217;s call). Reduce the Blast Template one size after a Wound; Small swarms are destroyed.<br>
Swarm: Parry +2. Because the swarm is composed of scores, hundreds, or thousands of creatures, cutting and piercing weapons do no real damage. Area effect weapons work normally, and a character can stomp to inflict his damage in Strength each round. Some swarms (bees, hornets, birds) may be foiled by total immersion in water.</p>

<p>As far back as the Stone Age, the Celts and Germanic tribes of Britannia and Northern Europe threw human sacrifices in dark bogs.

Burrow: Bog men move through water and boggy soil at Pace 6. When they erupt from the ground, victims must make a Notice roll opposed by the bog man&#8217;s Stealth. If the creature wins, it gains +2 to attack and damage that round, or +4 with a raise.<br>
Slam: Str.<br>
Strangle/Drown: Bog men usually attack by grappling their foes, inflicting Str damage each round. If their slam attack is a raise, however, they have grasped their foe around the neck or dragged them underwater. Victims must make a Vigor roll each round on the bog person&#8217;s Action Card (a free action) or suffer a level of Fatigue. This can lead to Death.<br>
Thermal Vision: Bog people have no eyes, just sunken pits, yet they can locate victims with ease. They suffer no penalties during the day, and halve all Darkness penalties.<br>
Undead: +2 Toughness; +2 to recover from being Shaken; no additional damage from called shots; immune to disease and poison; does not suffer wound penalties.<br>

<h3 id="_fog_of_war"><a class="anchor" href="#_fog_of_war"></a>Fog Of War</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Friendly fire” is present in every conflict, but more so during Rome&#8217;s frequent civil wars, when legionaries on both sides wear exactly the same armor. While much of it can be chalked up to the confusion inherent in battle, the fiendish creature known as the fog of war certainly does its best to facilitate such tragedies. In its natural form, a fog of war is a cloud of gray mist filling a Small Burst Template. Occasionally, the faces of pained and dying soldiers from various wars may appear fleetingly in the smoky form, psychic impressions left from previous victims. The fog of war is able to alter its form into nearly any shape of equal volume when the need arises. These sentient killers sow paranoia, fear, and confusion in an effort to promote friendly fire. They do this through subtle means, such as depriving troops of sleep and putting them on edge, altering perceptions with magical abilities, or simply dominating an officer to order an action leading to fratricide. Fogs of war find glee in such senseless and unfortunate deaths.</p>

Special Abilities<br>
Domination: A fog of war attacks victims simply by engulfing it within its foggy tendrils. Any creature caught inside must make a Vigor roll each round to avoid inhaling. Those who do are subject to domination by the fog of war. This works like the puppet spell, with the fog&#8217;s Spirit replacing the arcane skill roll. The Duration of this power is variable. So long as the victim remains within the fog, he is subject to the power. Once he leaves, it lasts for 10 rounds.<br>
Gaseous Form: As a result of its insubstantial nature, the creature suffers half damage from all forms of damage. It can pass through small holes or narrow openings. It can&#8217;t enter water or other liquid.<br>
Illusions: A fog of war can create minor illusions of sight and sound with a successful Spirit roll opposed by the target&#8217;s Smarts. Illusions have no physical form, and are used simply to confuse, startle, or disorient victims.<br>
Powers: A fog of war can use the obscure, speak language, and telekinesis powers using its Spirit as its arcane skill. It has unlimited Power Points.<br>
Weaknesses: Strong winds or rain quickly disperse the fog (1d4 rounds).</p>

<h3 id="_fury"><a class="anchor" href="#_fury"></a>Fury</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A fury forms from the tumult of frenzied activity found on battlefields where hand to hand combat takes place. The frenetic action, fear, rage, and death cause a whirling cloud of battlefield debris to form. This swirling mass of swords, spears, bits of armor, and even blood-soaked body parts rises up from the heaviest fighting and moves along the battle lines, attacking each side indiscriminately. In truly huge battles, several furies can form in different spots across the battlefield. Once the passions of combat subside, the fury will settle to the ground, becoming indistinguishable from the detritus of war.</p>

Swarm: Parry +2. The fury consists of scores of broken weapons, armor, and body parts. Cutting and piercing weapons do half damage. Area-effect weapons work normally.<br>
Weakness (Magic): Magical weapons (including those blessed by smite spells and the like) do full normal damage.<br>

<p>A 'glom (short for conglomerate) is a group of corpses joined together into a horrifying mass and animated by the weird energies generated on the battlefield. The parts of the component bodies can be seen clearly, although they are merged inseparably into a single horrific mass. The creation of a 'glom requires at least two corpses. One corpse, which forms the core of the creature, must be relatively intact, but the others needn&#8217;t be so tidy. Most 'gloms are formed from considerably more than two corpses. The 'glom is able to join additional corpses to its seething mass, increasing its power proportionately. 'Gloms use their limbs and whatever weapons are handy to kill any living person in sight. Whenever possible, 'gloms add corpses to their mass. 'Gloms can ranged weapons if available, though since its limbs often flail wildly, any shots fired by the 'glom suffer a -2 penalty.</p>

'Glom: A 'glom takes a full round to add a corpse to its mass. For every corpse after the second, the 'glom gains one die each in Strength and Vigor. It also gains +1 Size. A 'glom suffers no multi-action penalties until it takes more actions in a turn than it has corpses in its mass. A 'glom may grow as large as 10 corpses (Strength and Vigor d12+6, Size +9).<br>

<p>A hate is formed when multiple souls suffer a collective fate. They are most commonly found on battlefields, at scenes of massacres, and in death camps. When the bodies of the victims die, their souls flock to form a mass of swirling, screaming spirits. Hates are filled only with thoughts of vengeance. Although initially they target those who oppressed them in life, their desire for revenge can never be truly sated, and any living creature becomes suitable prey.</p>

<h3 id="_will_o_wisp"><a class="anchor" href="#_will_o_wisp"></a>Will O' Wisp</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Will o' wisps are the ghosts of men who died in lingering agony after being wounded, their piteous cries for help going unheeded. With their last breathe they cursed their god and their comrades, unintentionally binding their spirit to the killing ground. They manifest as small handfuls of flickering white flame that is oddly cold to the touch rather than hot. Some soldiers claim to have seen a grinning face inside a will o' wisp. A will o' wisp uses the glimmering light produced by its form to lure its intended victim to a secluded spot. Appearing to be a wounded man, the wisp favors its comrades whom it blames for its death. Once they approach, it weakens its victims with a fire seeming to spring from Hell itself. Once the target succumbs to the heat, the ghost possesses his corpse which immediately bursts aflame. These burning zombies are sometimes referred to as “flaming jacks.” The ghost uses the reanimated body to wreak as much havoc as it can before it is consumed by the creature&#8217;s otherworldly flames- usually against the other members of the litter team now. Initially, a will o' wisp haunts the area near its death, seeking vengeance on its former comrades. Once it has revenged itself, the hatred and anger that drove it to an undead existence continue to burn within the ghost. Some areas of No Man&#8217;s Land flicker with small lights once night falls over the blasted landscape. In these areas, litter teams often request chaplains to accompany them to perform “last rites” when they head out at night to recover the wounded following an offensive. The light of a will o' wisp varies from cold white to flame orange. The ghost can lessen its brilliance to that of a mere candle or brighten it to that of a torch at will.</p>

Flight: The will o' wisp flies at Pace 8. They may not “run."<br>
Focus: The ghost is tied to a specific talisman-usually an identity disk—which remains unnaturally hot to the touch (2d6 damage to exposed flesh). If this item is submerged in water, the will o' wisp suffers 2d6 damage per round as long as it remains so. If it is submerged in holy water, the wisp is destroyed immediately.<br>

Spiritual Exhaustion: A will o' wisp&#8217;s only means of attack in its initial form is by subjecting its victim to a supernatural heat only she can feel. The wisp and its target make an opposed Spirit roll. If the victim loses, the victim suffers a Fatigue level.<br>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Arboris bellum (war trees) are trees animated through dryad or special druidic magic. They are not sentient, but possess animal-like intelligence. Trees older than a century are Wild Cards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attributes: Agility d4, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d10, Strength d12+6, Vigor d10<br>
Skills: Fighting d8, Notice d6<br>
Pace: 6; Parry: 6; Toughness: 19 (4)<br>
Special Abilities<br>
Armor +4: Thick bark.<br>
Branch Swipe: Str+d6, Reach 2.<br>
Huge: Attackers are +4 to attack rolls against an arbor bellum due to its size.<br>
Plant: +2 to recover from being Shaken; No additional damage from Called Shots; Immune to poison and disease.<br>
Size +8: An arbor bellum is over 40' tall.<br>
Stomp: Str+8. The creature is naturally adept at using its full weight to smash its foes. Nonrigid armor (leather, any lorica armor) offers no protection against the stomp attack.<br>
Improved Sweep: An arbor bellum can attack all adjacent opponents in reach at no penalty.<br>
Weakness (Fire): Fire attacks cause +4 damage-unless it&#8217;s raining.</p>

<h4 id="_cloud_of_hate"><a class="anchor" href="#_cloud_of_hate"></a>Cloud Of Hate</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This entity resembles a noxious mist that flows in large pseudopods and writhing tentacles, filling a Large Burst Template. The cloud tries to influence any creature it touches, with the power of pure, white-hot rage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d4, Spirit d8, Strength d8, Vigor d8<br>
Skills: Fighting d8, Notice d8<br>
Pace: 6; Parry: 6; Toughness: 6<br>
Special Abilities<br>
Death Feeding: The Cloud of Hate grows stronger in the presence of death and destruction. For every four people slain in its presence, it gains +1 to Toughness and one die type of Strength for 1d6 hours (maximum of +2 and d12).<br>
Enthrall: The Cloud of Hate seeks out those filled with hatred and violence. It can use the puppet power, with a Range of Spirit * 2", using its Spirit as the arcane skill. The Cloud of Hate can cast and maintain the power indefinitely but may only affect a number of targets equal to its Spirit die value.<br>
Fearless: Immune to Fear and Intimidation.<br>
Invulnerability: The Cloud of Hate cannot be harmed by physical or magical attacks, except for its Weaknesses.<br>
Tendrils: When fully fed (+2 Toughness and d12 Strength), the Cloud of Hate can manifest up to ten tentacles (Str, Reach 1) capable of manipulating objects and wielding weapons. The cloud may use all its tentacles each round without a multi-action penalty.<br>
Weakness (Cord): The cloud is tethered to those who summoned it with a stream of pinkish-silver energy. This is the source from which the Cloud draws its power. Discovering the tether requires a successful Notice roll at -4. Attacking the cord requires a called shot at -2 and deals normal damage to the cloud.<br>
Weakness (Eye): The Cloud of Hate has a large central eye. Attacking the eye requires a called shot at -4. If the cloud suffers a wound from the attack, it is blinded instead, suffering a -6 to all rolls dependent on vision, including attacks.</p>

<h3 id="_corpse_raven_swarm"><a class="anchor" href="#_corpse_raven_swarm"></a>Corpse Raven (swarm)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Corpse ravens, found among the Gallic and Germanic lands, feast only on those fallen in battle. Some say they are servants of the barbarian gods of death, others insist they are pets of the gods of war, allowed to feed only on the flesh of heroes. Whoever they serve, they can raise the dead.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attributes: Agility d10, Smarts d6 (A), Spirit d8, Strength d8, Vigor d10<br>
Skills: Notice d6<br>
Pace: 10; Parry: 4; Toughness: 7<br>
Special Abilities<br>
Claw: Swarms inflict hundreds of tiny bites every round to their victims, hitting automatically and causing 2d4 damage to everyone in a Medium Burst Template. Damage is applied to the least armored location.<br>
Flight: Pace 8, Climb 3.<br>
Swarm: Parry +2; Because the swarm is composed of scores, hundreds, or thousands of creatures, cutting and piercing weapons do no real damage. Area-effect weapons work normally, and a character can stomp to inflict his damage in Strength each round. Swarms are usually foiled by jumping in water (unless they are aquatic pests, such as piranha).<br>
Zombie: Corpse ravens can settle on corpses and give them unlife. Roll a die per corpse. Odd, it rises as a zombie (see Savage Worlds). The undead is uncontrolled and attacks the nearest living target.</p>

Fear (-2): The sight of a beast man terrifies anyone who encounters one.<br>
Low Light Vision: Beast men ignore penalties for Dim and Dark lighting.<br>
Goat Feature - Gore: Beasts which move at least 6" can make a Horns attack with +4 damage.<br>
Horns: Str+d4.<br>
Infravision: Beasts halve penalties for dark lighting conditions against living targets (round down).<br>
Lord of the Pack: Every pack is led by the most powerful individual, a Wild Card with Strength, Vigor and Fighting raised by one die type. He can cast the boost trait, protection and sloth/ speed Powers with 10 Power Points, using Spirit as arcane skill.<br>
Disease: Anyone damaged by a beast&#8217;s physical attack  who fails a Vigor roll catches a nasty disease. Each day thereafter, the victim must make a Vigor roll or lose one die of Strength and Vigor. If either attribute drops below d4, the victim dies. A Healing roll may be attempted each day to cure the disease. Reduced attributes return at the rate of one die per day.</p>

<h3 id="_manticora"><a class="anchor" href="#_manticora"></a>Manticora</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A manticora has the body of a lion and a vaguely human head. Its mouth contains three rows of razor sharp teeth and its tail ends in a ball of darts or spines. Manticorae are fierce predators and devour every part of their victims, including their gear. They are most often encountered in the Asiatic provinces.</p>
</div>

Pace: 8; Parry: 6; Toughness: 9<br>
Special Abilities<br>
Bite/Claw: Str+d6.<br>
Defensive Volley: Rather than fire its tail darts at one target, the manticora may launch them in a circular pattern. The manticora makes a single Shooting roll against all target within range for 2d6 damage. The manticora may take no other actions in the round it uses this ability, including movement. This ability may be used only once per day and uses all the darts in the tail. There must be at least three volleys of darts left for this ability to work.<br>
Improved Frenzy: Manticorae may make two Fighting attacks each action at no penalty.<br>
Tail Darts: Each round, a manticora may fire a volley of darts at one target. Range 4/8/16, Damage 2d6. It may not fire its darts at the same target it attacks with its claws or bite during the same round. A manticora can only fire 10 volleys in a single day.<br>
Size +2: Manticorae weigh over 600 pounds.</p>

<h3 id="_nightgaunt"><a class="anchor" href="#_nightgaunt"></a>Nightgaunt</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These fell creatures were once normal men and women who made a dire pact with an evil entity. It is said that nightgaunts are created when one of these entities' servants fails in an appointed task and is transformed into a monster as punishment and example to the others. Nightgaunts look like hairless, naked humans with ebony-black skin, clawed hands and feet, bat wings sprouting from their back, and a blank, featureless oval for a face. These nocturnal creatures have a favorite tactic- swooping down upon a foe, grasping them in their foot-talons, then zooming upwards only to drop their helpless prey from a great height.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d6, Spirit d8, Strength d8, Vigor d8<br>
Skills: Fighting d8, Notice d6<br>
Pace: 6; Parry: 6; Toughness: 6<br>
Special Abilities<br>
Claws: Str+d6<br>
Fear: Seeing these twisted creatures causes a Fear check.<br>
Flight: Nightgaunts fly at Pace 18" with Climb 2.<br>
Improved Frenzy: Nightgaunts may make two Fighting attacks each action at no penalty.<br>
Quick: Nightgaunts are fast. They may discard Action Cards of 5 or lower and draw another. They must keep the replacement card, however.</p>
